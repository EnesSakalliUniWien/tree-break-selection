# Wiki Log

## Summary

Append meaningful scaffold, ingest, query, analysis, implementation, review,
verification, and maintenance events here in chronological order.

## Details

### 2026-05-24

- Scaffolded the docs-as-code wiki structure with `raw/`, `wiki/`, source,
  concept, entity, analysis, question, tool, candidate, and template
  directories.
- Added the root operating guide in `AGENTS.md`.
- Added [[schema]], [[maintenance]], [[wiki-search]], templates, and the
  `make wiki-lint` validation path.
- Captured the wiki construction brief in `raw/inbox/` and summarized it as
  [[wiki-construction-brief]].
- Seeded project and method pages: [[project-overview]], [[kl-te-method]],
  [[poset-tree]], [[tree-decomposition]], [[projected-wald-statistic]], and
  [[top-down-traversal]].
- Recorded wiki design references in [[github-wiki-structure-research]].
- Opened maintenance questions: [[generated-index]] and
  [[markdown-validation]].
- Added [[oracle-gate-path-diagnostic]] to record the mathematical
  recoverability oracle, corrected failure classes, gate-path trace evidence,
  and method implications from the current full KL benchmark diagnostics.
- Updated [[oracle-gate-path-diagnostic]] with the sibling-inflation follow-up:
  leave-one-out inflation still blocks the high-dimensional binary Gaussian
  case, the continuous Gaussian case lacks positive calibration support, and
  binary/categorical blockers are sibling-FDR failures rather than inflation
  failures. Recorded the next method step as a calibration-support contract
  plus a separate sibling-FDR analysis.
- Defined the sibling calibration-support contract in
  [[oracle-gate-path-diagnostic]]: strict empirical-null support,
  stopped-or-null support, selected non-null context only, and unsupported
  without target. Recorded that unsupported high-dimensional Gaussian contexts
  require an explicit calibration-data error or a separately validated external
  calibration model rather than a neutral fallback.
- Ran the support-status diagnostic on the two high-dimensional Gaussian
  blockers. Both lack admissible internal empirical-null calibration support;
  the binary case has selected non-null context only, and the continuous case
  lacks positive non-focal local calibration weight.
- Added the fixed-subspace Gaussian sibling-null diagnostic. The two
  high-dimensional Gaussian blockers have external mean-over-reference ratios
  near one, while runtime empirical inflation remains in the thousands. This
  points to a selection-conditioned calibration problem, not a failure of the
  projected-Wald chi-square reference.
- Added the level-1 local edge-selection sibling-null diagnostic. Conditioning
  on the child-parent edge gate raises the null ratio only to about 2.8--3.4
  for the two high-dimensional Gaussian blockers, still far below the runtime
  empirical inflation factors.
- Implemented the strict production sibling-calibration contract: the fitted
  inflation model now admits only strict-null or edge-blocked/stopped
  positive-weight records. Selected non-null records are rejected as
  calibration support instead of being used to estimate empirical-null
  inflation.
- Added the fixed-tree root Tree-BH selection diagnostic. For the two
  high-dimensional Gaussian blockers, the Tree-BH root edge-path event is
  equivalent to local edge selection and gives \(c\) about 2.8--3.5; production
  calibration is now reported as unsupported.

### 2026-05-25

- Tightened the calibration-support interpretation after the root Tree-BH
  diagnostic: current evidence does not justify a named external
  selection-conditioned production model. Missing internal empirical-null
  support remains a fail-closed production error; deeper full-selection
  conditioning is a research diagnostic, not a fallback.
- Consolidated repository structure: user-facing analysis commands now live in
  `scripts/analysis/`, benchmark diagnostics remain under
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/`, canonical feature matrices live under
  `data/feature_matrices/`, duplicate HC/CMS matrix aliases were removed, and
  generated report/log/notebook/profiling artifacts were removed from tracked
  source control.
- Added a new-contributor onboarding route in `docs/onboarding.md`, filled the
  statistics and benchmark-shared directory maps, and corrected stale package
  metadata/test documentation so a cold-start reader has one route through the
  project.
- Split benchmark diagnostics into purpose-named subdirectories:
  `oracle/`, `calibration/`, `failure/`, and `analysis/`. Updated imports,
  tests, benchmark docs, and the oracle gate-path wiki evidence paths without
  keeping old-path compatibility wrappers.
- Removed local workspace clutter from the repository root by moving large
  ignored artifacts to `/Users/berksakalli/Projects/kl-te-cluster-local-artifacts`
  and deleting cache/build products. Promoted only the small benchmark CSV/MD
  files cited by wiki or diagnostic notes into `raw/assets/benchmark-results/`
  so evidence paths remain durable without restoring `benchmarks/results/`.
- Added [[manuscript-life-science-readiness]] after checking the
  scientific-writing and life-science routing constraints. The page records
  that the draft is methods-coherent but cannot make a biological application
  claim until one real-data track has a locked manifest, outputs, figures, and
  interpretation table.
- Added [[open-mathematical-questions]] as the consolidated method backlog from
  the conversation and current manuscript/wiki gap markers. It separates
  calibration hierarchy, external conditional nulls, projected-Wald/PCA
  assumptions, feature-space covariance, sibling FDR, traversal, recoverability,
  and manuscript-evidence questions.
- Added [[local-marchenko-pastur-rule]] and a raw controlled-spectrum evidence
  note for the MP dimension-rule audit. The analysis records that the
  production MP edge is algebraically correct for the backend eigenvalue scale,
  but the finite-sample edge, minimum dimension floor, internal spectral rows,
  and unit-scale whitening assumption still need validation before being
  treated as calibrated defaults.
- Split the MP dimension contract in code: raw MP signal count, projected-Wald
  test dimension, effective independent row count, and MP threshold row count
  are now separate typed outputs. The spectral worker records descendant leaf
  count separately from the former augmented-row MP threshold when internal
  distributions are stacked for PCA directions. Added
  `compare_mp_dimension_contracts.py` plus subset and finite-null smoke CSV
  evidence under `raw/assets/mp-dimension-rule-analysis/`.

### 2026-05-26

- Ran a targeted MP threshold-policy smoke on high-cardinality categorical,
  dimensional Gaussian, high-dimensional binary, and heavy-overlap binary
  cases. The tested finite-null threshold is not a drop-in production
  replacement: it matched the current rule on `binary_many_features`, worsened
  `cat_highcard_20cat_4c`, and under-split dimensional Gaussian cases. Updated
  [[local-marchenko-pastur-rule]] and [[open-mathematical-questions]] to keep
  selection-aware MP calibration as an open research question rather than a
  production fallback.
- Added benchmark case-suite selection by mathematical input contract. The
  full runner now accepts `KL_TE_CASE_SUITE` with `binary`, `categorical`,
  `continuous`, `discretized_gaussian`, `graph`, or `full`, so native Bernoulli
  results can be interpreted separately from experimental continuous
  empirical-Gaussian results and historical discretized-Gaussian stress cases.
- Systematized generated benchmark metadata: every generated case now names a
  `source_family` and a `feature_representation`, and generator dispatch uses a
  single registry instead of a long conditional chain. This separates the
  stochastic source process from the matrix representation consumed by KL-TE;
  benchmark result rows preserve both fields.
- Split benchmark case-data generation by family while preserving
  `generate_case_data()` as the stable dispatch entry point. The continuous
  suite now contains 9 selected representation-forwarding examples, not one
  continuous clone per historical Gaussian stress case; the full suite now
  resolves to 110 cases.
- Added [[dimensional-gaussian-representation-diagnostic]] after the full
  benchmark showed that continuous representation improves consolidated
  dimensional Gaussian cases but not the diffuse case. The analysis records
  that consolidated continuous trees are recoverable because Euclidean distance
  preserves a large block-mean signal, while diffuse continuous trees remain
  unrecoverable because weak spread-out signal is dominated by noise dimensions.
- Added [[benchmark-pipeline-contract]] and tightened benchmark docs around the
  active execution order: full runner orchestration, optional subprocess
  isolation, shared one-case pipeline, generated-data validation, method
  dispatch, result-row construction, and report assembly. The page also records
  the strict precomputed KL tree-distance contract.
- Moved standalone benchmark experiments under `benchmarks/experiments/`, moved
  the subset and regression runners under `benchmarks/smoke/` and
  `benchmarks/regression/`, split active MP diagnostics into
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/`, and removed unused ad hoc diagnostics for
  old MP-switch, passthrough, and alpha-sweep investigations.
- Moved phylogenetic benchmark cases into `benchmarks/shared/cases/`, edge
  calibration diagnostics into `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/`, and the
  method-constant manifest into `benchmarks/validation/manifests/` so the
  benchmark root exposes only active domains.
- Added [[spectral-backend-runtime-diagnostic]] and
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/profile_spectral_backends.py`. The
  representative profile shows that spectral runtime is dominated by
  null-whitened tangent matrix materialization, not SciPy eigendecomposition;
  exact diagonal vectorization matched current matrices and was about
  \(194\times\) to \(654\times\) faster on Bernoulli/continuous diagonal
  feature spaces.
- Installed `ruff` as a project development dependency and into the active
  Python environment so both `ruff` and `python -m ruff` use an explicit
  dependency. Ran a broader 18-additional-case spectral backend profile,
  confirming the same materialization bottleneck in Gaussian, binary,
  continuous, outlier, SBM, categorical, phylogenetic, overlap, and quantile
  one-hot cases. The remaining non-diagonal speed target is grouped
  multinomial/simplex whitening for categorical and phylogenetic blocks.
- Implemented exact vectorized diagonal null-whitening in
  `contrast_covariance.py` for pure one-dimensional Bernoulli and continuous
  empirical-Gaussian feature spaces. The repair preserves the same whitening
  formulas while avoiding generic per-block Cholesky work and generic
  per-block validation. Post-repair profiles reduced `binary_many_features`
  from about 3.25 s to 0.11 s and `gauss_extreme_noise_highd_continuous` from
  about 91.10 s to 1.05 s in the spectral worker. Updated
  [[spectral-backend-runtime-diagnostic]] with the post-change evidence.
- Implemented exact grouped multinomial null-whitening for pure categorical
  and phylogenetic one-hot feature spaces in `contrast_covariance.py`. The
  repair preserves the same drop-last simplex covariance map while batching
  Cholesky/solve work by category count. A production A/B comparison matched
  the generic block path exactly on selected categorical and phylogenetic
  cases; post-repair profiles reduced `cat_highd_3cat_500feat` from about
  14.86 s to 0.31 s, `phylo_dna_16taxa_low_mut` from about 21.83 s to 0.46 s,
  and `phylo_large_32taxa` from about 27.32 s to 0.70 s in the spectral worker.
- Removed stale numeric gate terminology from active code, benchmark timing
  fields, tests, scripts, and method notes. The canonical split contract is
  now the binary structure prerequisite, edge-divergence gate, and
  sibling-divergence gate; node distributions are documented as empirical
  subtree barycenters where that weighted-center construction is actually
  used.

### 2026-06-01

- Settled the active feature covariance contract. Generated continuous
  benchmark inputs now use one empirical-Gaussian block spanning the raw
  continuous columns, categorical one-hot blocks are explicitly
  `multinomial_drop_last`, and the old continuous diagonal whitening shortcut
  was removed from active covariance code. Updated
  [[open-mathematical-questions]] to mark covariance shape as settled while
  preserving validation gaps for high-cardinality categorical and continuous
  finite-sample calibration.
- Added `benchmarks/validation/feature_covariance_calibration.py` as a strict
  evidence generator for the two remaining feature-covariance validation
  targets:
  `categorical_multinomial_drop_last_covariance` and
  `continuous_empirical_gaussian_covariance`. The scaffold records local
  sibling-null full-tangent Wald calibration metrics, confidence intervals,
  p-value uniformity diagnostics, seed, commit, dirty-worktree status, command,
  and limitations; it does not claim to validate selected projections, MP
  selection, sibling FDR, traversal, tree construction, or empirical-null
  inflation.
- Audited installation and benchmark-entrypoint hygiene. The canonical setup
  path is now `uv venv --python 3.11 .venv` followed by
  `uv sync --extra dev --extra benchmark --extra viz --locked`; the
  `requirements.txt` fallback, direct benchmark path-bootstrap helper, pytest
  import path injection, and bare `pytest`/direct benchmark documentation were
  removed from active project surfaces.
- Added a preflight implementation contract for dense empirical-Gaussian
  continuous covariance. The exact dense path now raises a clear unsupported
  error for oversized \(p \gg n\) continuous blocks instead of allowing the
  process to be killed by scatter-matrix allocation. The 2026-06-01 full
  benchmark completed with plots disabled after the 20,000-feature continuous
  stress case was recorded as an explicit KL skip; a validated low-rank or
  regularized continuous covariance model remains open.
- Corrected manuscript and wiki method text that still described KL-TE as a
  discrete-only or discretize-continuous pipeline. The manuscript now describes
  the active typed feature-space contract: Bernoulli coordinates, categorical
  one-hot blocks with drop-last multinomial covariance, and explicit continuous
  empirical-Gaussian blocks. Discretized Gaussian inputs are now described only
  as benchmark variants.
- Added a selected-PCA projected-Wald validation scaffold. The scaffold isolates
  the fixed-membership Gaussian sibling-null question where PCA rows and MP
  projection dimension are selected from the same local null-whitened rows used
  by the tested contrast; it explicitly does not validate hierarchy selection,
  sibling FDR, traversal, or empirical-null inflation.
- Ran the selected-PCA projected-Wald validation scaffold at commit
  `492c8520809e6cfad9e4853e91c89a887eac5a21` with seed `20260601` and 1000
  replicates per setting. Leaf-only Gaussian selected PCA was calibrated in the
  tested settings, while child-mean internal spectral rows caused severe
  anti-conservative rejection rates. The locked JSON/CSV evidence is stored
  under `raw/assets/selected-pca-projected-wald-validation/`.
- Removed the production internal-spectral-row configuration and made the
  inferential projected-Wald spectral basis descendant-leaf-only. The
  regression-gate benchmark completed under this stricter contract with mean
  ARI `0.6017`, median ARI `0.6803`, exact \(K\) in 4 of 17 rows, and six
  explicit unsupported-calibration skips. A floor diagnostic showed that
  \(k_{\min}=1\) reduces skips but lowers aggregate ARI, so the exposed problem
  is missing empirical-null calibration support rather than an internal-row or
  floor fallback. Updated [[local-marchenko-pastur-rule]],
  [[selected-pca-projected-wald-validation]], and
  [[open-mathematical-questions]] with the benchmark reaction.
- Ran the full KL-only benchmark with plots and relationship analysis disabled
  under the leaf-only spectral contract. The run completed 110 cases with 85
  `ok` rows, 25 explicit `skip` rows, valid-row mean ARI `0.8612`, valid-row
  median ARI `1.0`, and exact \(K\) in 63 of 110 rows. The full CSV and failure
  report are stored under `raw/assets/mp-dimension-rule-analysis/`.
- Decomposed the unsupported sibling-calibration problem to its upstream edge
  source. A current support audit found that 24 of 25 full-benchmark skipped
  rows rebuild through edge and sibling-record collection, but every one has
  zero strict-null or stopped-edge empirical-null calibration records. The
  edge-selection null audit then showed that pure null data rejects about
  `99%` of child-parent edges when the hierarchy is selected from the same data,
  while fixed-tree feature permutations have median rejection rate `0.0`.
  Added [[edge-selection-null-audit-20260601]] and updated
  [[oracle-gate-path-diagnostic]] and [[open-mathematical-questions]].
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/sample_split_selection_audit.py`.
  The script explicitly rejects literal sample splitting because KL-TE uses a
  sample-leaf hierarchy and held-out samples have no canonical training-tree
  node membership. It implements the valid feature-split cross-fit diagnostic:
  build the tree from one feature block, test gates on a held-out feature block,
  and compare against in-sample and fixed-tree feature-permutation regimes.
  The first run is stored under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/sample_split_selection_audit_20260601/` and
  summarized in an audit page that has since been removed.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/selected_hierarchy_null_audit.py`
  to estimate the same-data selected-hierarchy sibling null directly. The
  first Bernoulli/categorical run used 20 null replicates on four
  representative cases. Selected-hierarchy correction factors were large
  (`28.8` to `58.5`), blocked the null case, and still rejected the three
  signal examples under the mean-scaled chi-square summary. The evidence is
  stored under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/selected_hierarchy_null_audit_20260601/` and
  summarized in [[selected-hierarchy-null-audit-20260601]].
- Added [[selected-hierarchy-selection-geometry]] to consolidate the geometric
  explanation behind the selected-hierarchy calibration problem. The page
  separates fixed projected-Wald tangent geometry from same-data hierarchy
  selection, where internal node barycenters, child-parent edges, and focal
  sibling contexts are selected high-contrast objects rather than ordinary
  fixed-tree null contrasts.
- Tightened `selected_hierarchy_null_audit.py` so selected records require an
  open child-parent edge path, added explicit non-root target modes, and added
  projection/parent-size/depth context matching. The 100-replicate richer root
  rerun still blocks `gauss_null_large` and leaves the three signal examples
  significant. The non-root strongest rerun has matched Gaussian support but
  zero matched binary/categorical support under the strict context, marking a
  diagnostic support limitation rather than a calibration estimate or fallback
  decision.
- Added selected-hierarchy diagnostic precision fields: record-level and
  simulation-level standard errors for \(c\), empirical-tail standard errors,
  and tail-resolution diagnostics. The 100-replicate richer runs describe the
  large selected-hierarchy scale effect, but their empirical-tail resolution is
  too coarse to be a production external-calibration validation at
  `SIBLING_ALPHA = 0.01`.
- Ran 500-replicate descriptive selected-hierarchy precision studies for root
  and non-root strongest targets, plus a non-root context-relaxation ladder for
  binary and categorical rows. The strict root and Gaussian non-root rows keep
  \(c\) in the tens with improved precision. Non-root binary/categorical support
  is sparse under exact depth matching but returns when depth and parent-size
  are relaxed, showing a support-geometry phenomenon rather than a production
  borrowing rule.
- Added [[selected-hierarchy-null-support-contract]] to formalize the
  diagnostic support states, no-fallback rule, current exact matching variables,
  descriptive stratifiers, and Monte Carlo precision targets for
  selected-hierarchy null studies.
- Added `selected_hierarchy_stratification_diagnostic.py` and ran a
  500-replicate stratification study over the four representative selected-null
  cases. The diagnostic groups selected edge-path-open sibling records by
  parent depth and parent-size bins. It shows that small selected parent nodes
  often have higher selected-null scale than root-like selected nodes, while
  exact depth is too sparse to promote to a validated exact conditioning
  variable. Added
  [[selected-hierarchy-stratification-diagnostic-20260602]].
- Extended the selected-hierarchy stratification evidence to record the
  selected-ratio law \(R=W/(a\nu)\), raw statistic quantiles, reference
  expectations, and standard projected-Wald rejection rates inside each
  descriptive stratum. The compact 500-replicate output still writes no
  per-record dump and remains diagnostic-only, not a calibration fallback.
- Added `selected_hierarchy_external_calibration_contract.py` and ran a
  500-replicate external selected-hierarchy calibration contract diagnostic.
  The production tail-resolution rule requires `499` independent matching
  simulations at `SIBLING_ALPHA = 0.01`; no current row is production
  admissible. Scalar mean scaling is conservative in reliable rows but not
  distribution-calibrated, so future external calibration would need a
  selected-ratio tail law rather than a scalar fallback. Added
  [[selected-hierarchy-external-calibration-contract-20260602]].

### 2026-06-02

- Added `selected_hierarchy_geometry_covariates.py` and ran a 100-replicate
  diagnostic over four representative Bernoulli/categorical selected-null
  cases. The run records row-level tree geometry, edge p-values, eigenvalue
  summaries, and angular alignment between the selected sibling contrast and
  the selected PCA subspace. Edge-selection strength is the largest recorded
  correlate of log selected-ratio; spectral and angular variables add smaller
  descriptive structure. Added
  [[selected-hierarchy-geometry-covariates-20260602]] and kept the result
  explicitly diagnostic-only, not a production external calibration model.
- Added [[selected-hierarchy-geometric-law-map]] to separate actual method laws
  from physical analogies for the selected-hierarchy variables. The map links
  projected-Wald energy to the chi-square law, edge-selection strength to a
  large-deviation/action coordinate, eigenvalues to Marchenko--Pastur spectral
  modes, angles to Pythagorean projection, parent size/balance to sampling
  variance, branch lengths to phylogenetic covariance context, and node
  distributions to barycentric coarse-graining.
- Extended the selected-hierarchy geometry diagnostic with candidate-equation
  scoring. The compact edge-plus-spectral equation nearly matches the full
  descriptive equation for top-10% selected-ratio tail discrimination, while
  the full equation fits mean log-ratio better. The result defines the next
  validation target, not a production law.
- Added candidate-equation holdout scoring to
  `selected_hierarchy_geometry_covariates.py` and reran the same 100-replicate
  four-case panel. Replicate-fold holdout preserves strong tail ranking for
  the compact edge-plus-spectral equation, and leave-one-case-out transfer
  makes it more stable than the larger full descriptive candidate for tail
  discrimination. Updated [[selected-hierarchy-geometry-covariates-20260602]]
  and [[selected-hierarchy-geometric-law-map]] while keeping the result
  diagnostic-only.
- Added source-family holdout to the geometry diagnostic and ran a broad
  200-replicate panel over Gaussian, dimensional Gaussian, binary,
  high-cardinality/high-dimensional categorical, heavy-overlap binary,
  phylogenetic, and SBM boundary cases. Eight cases completed; `sbm_moderate`
  was an explicit precomputed-distance null-generator boundary skip. The
  broad evidence separates global top-tail ranking from calibrated selected
  scale: simple edge/spectral scores rank tails well, while absolute
  selected-ratio scale varies strongly by family and still needs a selected
  tail-law target rather than a production fallback.
- Added a within-context selected-ratio tail-law diagnostic to the same
  selected-hierarchy geometry tool. The context uses source family, feature
  family, parent-size bin, sibling projection dimension, and binned edge
  action. A broad 200-replicate run produced descriptive held-out tail-law
  rows but no production-admissible context under the strict `499` matching
  simulation, `499` matched record, and `0.002` held-out SE contract. Added
  [[selected-ratio-tail-law-diagnostic-20260602]].
- Tightened selected-ratio tail-law support counting to use the explicit
  `selected_hierarchy_simulation_id` case-replicate unit rather than bare
  `replicate_index`. Regenerating the broad 200-replicate result leaves the
  production conclusion unchanged: `0` of `104` contexts are admissible, and
  the largest context has `376` independent matching simulations.
- Ran a focused 300-replicate selected-tail support study over multi-case
  `gaussian_blobs`, `binary_template`, and `categorical_multinomial` source
  families. Two exact small-parent, high-edge-action Gaussian contexts become
  production-admissible under the diagnostic support contract. Categorical
  contexts approach but do not reach the `499` simulation threshold, and binary
  contexts remain support-fragmented.
- Added [[selected-geometry-mp-integral-literature-20260602]] after checking
  selective-inference and random-matrix references for the no-bootstrap
  analytic direction. The wiki now records signed distance, curvature,
  tangent-cone selected-region geometry as the retained selective-inference
  object, and the Silverstein--Choi/Ledoit--Wolf Stieltjes-transform integral
  route as the analytic generalization of the current identity
  Marchenko--Pastur edge.
- Added `local_mp_identity_law_diagnostic.py` and
  [[local-mp-identity-law-diagnostic-20260602]]. The representative screen
  shows frequent near-edge or above-edge identity-MP spikes in selected
  Bernoulli/discretized spectra, mixed categorical behavior, and continuous
  empirical-covariance spectra far below the identity-MP positive support. A
  self-whitening check explains the continuous result: the positive eigenvalues
  match the finite-rank \((m_u-1)/m_u\) covariance scale. The result supports a
  deformed/effective local spectral-law question, not a bootstrap threshold
  fallback.
- Extended the local MP identity-law diagnostic with a finite identity-null
  top-edge comparison. The split is now sharper: selected
  Gaussian-null/high-dimensional Bernoulli/diffuse discretized spectra exceed
  the finite-null 95% envelope in roughly `55%`--`72%` of evaluated nodes,
  while high-cardinality/high-dimensional categorical screens are closer to
  ordinary finite fluctuation at about `7%`--`12%`.
- Extended the same diagnostic with selected-tree spectral-law covariates and
  categorical extreme-node output. The rerun keeps the Bernoulli/discretized
  interpretation as broad selected spectral inflation, while categorical
  behavior separates into selected extreme nodes: `cat_highcard_20cat_4c` is
  strongly tied to node size/aspect ratio, and `cat_highd_3cat_500feat` mixes
  root/half-tree extremes with many tiny selected extreme nodes.
- Added [[hierarchy-gate-separation-20260603]] after rerunning oracle
  recoverability on the `85` runnable rows from the latest strict KL-only full
  benchmark and tracing the five runnable gate failures. The current full
  separation is `62` solved, `24` calibration-support-undefined skips, `14`
  tree/metric unrecoverable rows, `4` gate over-splits, `4`
  oracle-matched-below-solved rows, `1` continuous covariance boundary, and
  `1` gate under-split.
- Added [[method-proof-web]] to connect the fixed-object proof spine
  (feature-space covariance, whitening, fixed projection, projected-Wald
  chi-square law, MP dimension rule) with the selected-hierarchy proof gap
  (selected region, selected-ratio tail law, admissible empirical/external
  calibration support, and oracle recoverability separation).
- Added [[root-selected-region-model]] as the first simplified selected-region
  target: root sibling selection with fixed hierarchy-construction procedure,
  merge inequalities, root edge-opening inequalities, and explicit
  differential-geometric objects for signed distance, tangent cone, and
  curvature.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/root_selected_region_margins.py`
  and [[root-selected-region-margins-20260603]]. The diagnostic replays
  average-linkage merge-selection inequalities for observed root contexts,
  joins them to root edge/sibling/spectral quantities, and records that
  representative Hamming/discretized/categorical root cells are tie-heavy while
  the continuous Euclidean representative has positive construction margins.
- Extended the root selected-region margin diagnostic to schema `v2`: smooth
  Euclidean average-linkage constraints now record the first-order signed
  distance \(m_t/\|\nabla g_t\|\), while Hamming/discrete cases are explicitly
  classified as discrete tie-cell geometry. The representative continuous case
  has minimum first-order signed distance about `2.24e-4`; curvature and
  null-whitened distance remain open.
- Extended the same diagnostic to schema `v3` with root empirical-Gaussian
  null-whitened first-order merge distance and a relationship table. In the
  supported eight-case continuous panel, edge action has Spearman correlation
  `1.0` with log root sibling selected ratio, while raw merge margin,
  ambient signed distance, and null-whitened merge distance have weak
  relationships. The next selected-region object is therefore the edge-opening
  boundary/action, not more merge-margin tuning.
- Extended the root selected-region diagnostic to schema `v4` with explicit
  fixed-subspace projected-Wald edge-opening geometry. The active edge
  annotation contract now preserves `Child_Parent_Divergence_Test_Statistic`;
  the diagnostic records edge-path radial distance
  \(\sqrt Q-\sqrt{q_{1-\alpha,k}}\), statistic margin, and Tree-BH action.
  In the supported eight-case continuous panel, all three edge-opening
  coordinates have Spearman correlation `1.0` with log root sibling selected
  ratio, while merge-boundary distances remain weak.
- Extended the root selected-region diagnostic to schema `v5` with the
  edge/sibling Wald relationship. The diagnostic now verifies that, under the
  active no-branch-scaling barycentric parent contract, root child-parent edge
  z-vectors equal \(z_{L,R}\) and \(-z_{L,R}\) up to numerical residuals. The
  supported continuous root panel has zero extra edge projection energy beyond
  the sibling projection, so local edge and sibling statistics use the same
  projected barycentric energy before thresholds, Tree-BH, sibling
  FDR/inflation, and selected conditioning are applied.
- Extended the root selected-region diagnostic to schema `v6` with the
  fixed-projection sibling tail conditional only on root edge opening, plus
  the current internal empirical-inflation sibling tail or explicit
  unsupported status. The diagnostic shows that edge conditioning alone does
  not explain diffuse-dimensional root blockers: raw and edge-conditioned
  sibling p-values remain significant, while the empirical-inflation layer can
  block. The next mathematical target is therefore the empirical-inflation
  versus fuller selected-hierarchy law, not another root edge-opening
  truncation formula.
- Checked the selective-inference literature framing against the manuscript
  assumptions section. `assumptions_validation.tex`, `sibling_test.tex`, the
  notation table, and the method logic guide now cite the selection-event
  conditioning literature where the assumption is stated and describe the
  active empirical-null inflation contract as joint child-edge null-evidence
  weights plus feature-family/context-vector localization, not the older
  geometric-mean scalar-context description. The wiki oracle gate-path page now
  records the same active support-set notation.
- Added
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/internal_vs_selected_hierarchy_inflation.py`
  and [[internal-vs-selected-hierarchy-inflation-20260603]]. The diagnostic
  compares active internal empirical-null inflation with regenerated
  selected-hierarchy descriptive scale for the same root sibling target without
  installing an external fallback. In `dim_diffuse_6c_136f`, the internal and
  selected-hierarchy scales agree (`85.27` versus `86.23`); in
  `gauss_null_large` and `cat_highcard_20cat_4c`, selected-hierarchy support
  exists descriptively while internal production support remains absent.
- Clarified the manuscript logic map, method validation table, and wiki index
  wording for selected-tail calibration. The focused selected-ratio tail-law
  study did find two narrow admissible Gaussian small-parent, high-edge-action
  contexts; the external calibration law remains undefined outside such
  predeclared admissible contexts and is not a general fallback.
- Ran a 500-replicate selected-tail admissibility boundary study over
  comparable Gaussian and categorical source families and added
  [[selected-tail-admissibility-domain-20260603]]. After that run, the
  admissible domain included Gaussian and categorical `small_0_0.25`,
  `edge_action_ge8` contexts with sibling projection dimension `1` and `2`.
  Root, medium-parent, large-parent, lower-edge-action, binary, continuous, and
  precomputed-distance contexts remain outside the current admissible
  production domain.
- Ran a 600-replicate binary selected-tail boundary study and regenerated the
  admissibility-domain table. `binary_template`, `small_0_0.25`,
  `edge_action_ge8`, sibling projection dimension `1` is now admissible with
  `606` independent matching simulations; the corresponding binary
  projection-2 context remains support-limited at `445/499` simulations.
- Added [[phylogenetic-ml-topological-selected-tail-literature-20260603]] after
  checking phylogenetic, machine-learning selective-inference, distance-based
  inference, and topological graph literature. The durable conclusion is that
  medium/large parent contexts likely lack tail homogeneity when support
  exists but held-out precision fails; topology, balance, merge persistence,
  covariance condition, ancestor edge action, and spectral alignment are
  diagnostic coordinates, not fallback calibration rules.
- Added `selected_tail_topology_refinement.py`, topology fields to the
  row-level selected-hierarchy geometry diagnostic, and
  [[selected-tail-topology-refinement-20260603]]. A 300-replicate
  Gaussian/categorical panel shows that exact balance, topology,
  merge-persistence, edge-path, spectral-alignment, and compact combined
  refinements do not restore medium/large selected-tail production
  admissibility. The result points toward a lower-dimensional modeled
  selected-tail law rather than exact multiway topology matching.
- Debugged the topology-refinement admissibility wording after noticing that
  data-adaptive refinement bins were being summarized with production
  admissibility language. The diagnostic now separates
  `diagnostic_tail_law_contract_passed` from
  `production_tail_law_admissible`; only predeclared base contexts can be
  production-admissible. Regenerated
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/selected_tail_topology_refinement_20260603_300/`
  and updated [[selected-tail-topology-refinement-20260603]],
  [[selected-hierarchy-null-support-contract]], and
  [[open-mathematical-questions]].
- Debugged the selected-tail artifact contract after finding that several
  `selected_ratio_tail_law.csv` files relied on the manifest-only precision
  threshold while downstream summaries used a hidden `0.002` constant. The
  tail-law evaluator now writes `max_exceedance_standard_error` into every
  row, topology and admissibility-domain summaries read that column, and the
  affected benchmark CSVs plus
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/selected_tail_admissibility_domain_20260603/`
  were regenerated or schema-migrated from their recorded manifests.
- Rechecked the other mathematical analyses against their verification
  artifacts. Selected-PCA, local MP, root selected-region, internal-vs-selected
  inflation, and hierarchy-gate numeric claims match the cited CSV/JSON files.
  Corrected stale selected-PCA evidence wording to the current leaf-only
  production spectral contract. Added the 300-replicate topology-input
  candidate-equation transfer result: edge-sampling and edge-spectral equations
  transfer across source families, while selected-energy and full descriptive
  equations fail that split and remain variable-screening diagnostics only.
- Added `benchmarks/cloud/aws_selected_tail_equation_study.py`,
  `benchmarks/cloud/aws/Dockerfile`, and
  [[aws-selected-tail-equation-study]] so the selected-tail equation study can
  run as AWS Batch shards and merge row-level records into one recomputed
  diagnostic output. During this cleanup, geometry case summaries were moved
  to the explicit `selected_hierarchy_simulation_id` contract so cloud shards
  cannot undercount independent regenerations by reusing local replicate
  indices.
- Deployed the AWS Batch selected-tail stack in account `067744548702`, pushed
  `067744548702.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kl-te-selected-tail:latest`,
  ran a successful one-shard smoke job, then ran the 20-shard selected-tail
  cloud diagnostic and merge job. Synced compact merged outputs into
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/selected_tail_equation_cloud_run_20260603_1000/`
  and added [[selected-tail-equation-cloud-run-20260603]]. The row-level
  merged table remains in S3 because it is `261.5 MiB`. Added
  `local_deployment_context.json` because the container did not include `.git`
  and therefore could not record commit/branch inside its generated manifest.
- Rebuilt and pushed the AWS Batch image after adding explicit
  `KL_TE_GIT_COMMIT` and `KL_TE_GIT_BRANCH` build arguments plus `.dockerignore`
  pruning. The post-run rebuilt smoke job
  `5d72447b-9921-4163-8249-df4b922f912a` succeeded and its shard manifest
  records `build_commit=a61f1cfe81ded8923b4f11cc16697036f0ed6220` and
  `build_branch=dev`.
- Reran the AWS selected-tail equation experiment with the rebuilt image,
  base seed `20260604`, array job
  `dfbd5d03-5862-47fa-9966-db1c5301c187`, and merge job
  `1b869dc6-b4cd-43f3-9467-c95f66d24154`. Synced compact merged outputs into
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/selected_tail_equation_cloud_run_20260604_1000/`
  and added [[selected-tail-equation-cloud-run-20260604]]. The rerun reproduced
  the same seven admissible contexts as the 2026-06-03 run and no
  admissibility-status changes.
- Debugged the 2026-06-04 cloud run contract. The AWS runner evaluated the six
  predeclared descriptive candidate functions from
  `selected_hierarchy_geometry_covariates.py` and did not introduce additional
  fitted law families. The `271,801` selected-record count differs from the
  `271,798` candidate-equation row count because three selected Gaussian rows
  have zero selected-hierarchy ratio and therefore undefined log response.
- Audited selected-tail result weighting for the 2026-06-04 cloud run. The
  run is arithmetically consistent, but candidate-equation scores are
  selected-node weighted: `gauss_null_large` contributes `63.6%` of rows versus
  `30.8%` of independent selected simulations. Equal-simulation weighting
  keeps `edge_spectral_modes` as the strongest tested coordinate, but with a
  lower top-tail AUC of about `0.927`, so the result remains a search
  direction rather than a calibrated production law.
- Debugged benchmark creation and representation contracts. A generation audit
  over the 110 default cases found no case-recipe geometry, label-length,
  value-domain, forwarded-representation, or precomputed-distance metadata
  mismatch. The actual skew was method compatibility: `kl_diffusion` used
  Hamming diffusion on continuous float matrices and could return `ok` rows
  with meaningless ARI. The Hamming diffusion runner now rejects continuous
  `FeatureSpace` inputs and non-binary values, and the full-run console summary
  labels mean ARI as ok-row-only while printing method status counts.
- Added a canonical statistical decision trace derived from the gate-path
  diagnostic. The trace records edge raw/BH p-values, traversal-aligned sibling
  BH state, empirical-inflation status, calibration-support status, and final
  traversal decision in one stable table. Removed the optional sibling-FDR
  early-return helper and updated active documentation to describe the current
  traversal-aligned sibling BH contract rather than stale flat-BH wording.
- Added [[sibling-null-prior-interpolation-audit-20260604]] and
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit.py`
  to reconstruct the old tree-neighborhood sibling-null prior score as a
  diagnostic-only table. The four-case run shows positive interpolated weights
  on selected non-null records while strict internal support remains absent,
  confirming that the old score describes support failure but is not admissible
  empirical-null calibration. Verified with
  `tests/validation/60_test_sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit.py` and
  wrote compact outputs under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit_20260604/`.
- Ran the same interpolation audit over the 24 KL calibration-support skips
  from the complete `run_20260604_115308Z_full` benchmark. All 24 remain
  `no_strict_internal_support`; 23 receive positive diagnostic interpolated
  selected-nonnull weights, while `gauss_extreme_noise_highd` receives none.
  Recorded outputs under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit_full_skips_20260604/`.
- Removed statistical alpha thresholds from mutable `config.py` and introduced
  `kl_clustering_analysis/hierarchy_analysis/statistics/alpha_contract.py` as
  the canonical source for `DEFAULT_EDGE_ALPHA = 0.001` and
  `DEFAULT_SIBLING_ALPHA = 0.01`. Benchmark KL rows now record both alpha
  values in their parameter contract, and decomposition output reports both
  edge and sibling alpha values.
- Removed the disabled branch-length variance-scaling config path from the
  active projected-Wald kernel. Branch lengths remain valid tree metadata and
  diagnostic/topological covariates, but they no longer enter edge or sibling
  Wald variance through a hidden runtime switch.
- Added [[alpha-grid-full-20260604]] after running the AWS full-suite alpha
  grid over `25` edge/sibling alpha pairs. The current default pair
  `edge_alpha = 0.001` and `sibling_alpha = 0.01` had the best mean ARI in
  the grid, while lower edge alpha had more exact cluster-count hits. Recorded
  this as benchmark evidence, not a selected-tree Type-I proof.
- Added `benchmarks/validation/selected_edge_type1_geometry.py`,
  `benchmarks/cloud/aws_selected_edge_type1_geometry.py`, and
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/analysis/selected_edge_geometry_analysis.py` for a
  strict selected-edge Type-I geometry diagnostic. Ran local direct,
  local shard/merge, Docker shard/merge, and AWS Batch pilot checks. The AWS
  pilot used four shards, two binary global-null cases, two edge alpha values,
  and `40` replicates, producing `40,960` edge rows. Same-data selected-tree
  mode rejected about `99.6%` to `99.8%` of Tree-BH-tested frontier edges,
  while strict sibling-calibration support failures remained explicit. Added
  [[selected-edge-type1-geometry-pilot-20260604]] and updated
  [[open-mathematical-questions]].
- Extended the selected-edge diagnostic to direct categorical multinomial
  nulls with an explicit categorical `FeatureSpace`, while leaving continuous
  null regeneration as a hard unsupported state. Ran the AWS binary/categorical
  pilot with four cases, four shards, and `40` replicates, producing
  `136,320` edge rows. The run confirms selected-tree frontier rejection near
  one across binary and categorical nulls, and exposes high-cardinality
  categorical fixed-tree frontier inflation as a separate open calibration
  problem. Added [[selected-edge-binary-categorical-pilot-20260604]].
- Added `benchmarks/validation/traversal_sibling_fdr_null.py` and
  `benchmarks/cloud/aws_traversal_sibling_fdr_null.py` to separate sibling FDR
  algorithm behavior from fixed-tree projected-Wald calibration, same-data
  selected-tree calibration, and empirical-inflation support. The local smoke
  recorded mean FDP `0.03` for synthetic valid p-values at sibling alpha
  `0.01`, mean FDP `0.25` for fixed-tree raw Wald on `binary_2clusters`, mean
  FDP `0.95` for selected-tree raw Wald, and `18/20` support failures for the
  active inflated selected-tree layer. Added
  [[traversal-sibling-fdr-smoke-20260604]] and kept the result classified as
  smoke evidence, not final FDR calibration.
- Ingested
  `raw/inbox/calibration-contract-enhancement-request-20260604.txt` and added
  [[calibration-contract-enhancement-request-20260604]]. Implemented explicit
  internal `CalibrationDecision` statuses for sibling empirical-null
  calibration, preserved scalar prediction as an admissibility-checked
  compatibility helper, and corrected `manuscript/sections/method/edge_test.tex`
  from historical internal-row spectral matrices to the production leaf-only
  inferential PCA contract.
- Updated [[open-mathematical-questions]] to separate the new code-level
  `CalibrationDecision` status contract from still-open mathematical validation
  questions about effective internal support thresholds, leave-one-target
  stability, and external selected-tail admissibility.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/selected_tail_law_q5_validation.py`
  and [[selected-tail-law-q5-validation-20260604]] for Q5. The diagnostic fits
  residual-tail models using edge severity, parent size, sibling projection
  dimension, feature family, parent-size bin, and spectral geometry on the
  300-replicate row-level selected-geometry table. The full Q5 model validates
  on replicate holdout but fails case/parent-size extrapolation, while the
  edge-plus-spectral model transfers best; the result remains diagnostic and
  not a production external calibration law.
- Ingested `raw/inbox/recursive-method-program-20260604.txt` and added
  [[recursive-method-followups-20260604]]. Implemented Q9/Q11
  support-threshold reporting and opt-in sparse-context enforcement, added the
  Q10 sibling empirical-null weight-rule diagnostic grid, ran the Q14/Q15
  MP/minimum-dimension smoke, and added the Q17 sibling projection-dimension
  rule-grid diagnostic. Updated [[open-mathematical-questions]] so these items
  are marked as partially answered by code or diagnostics while Q19--Q44 remain
  larger idea and validation tracks.
- Ingested `raw/inbox/barycentric-method-literature-request-20260604.txt` and
  added [[barycentric-method-literature-request-20260604]]. Expanded the
  manuscript method with the barycentric parent formula, the edge/sibling
  whitened z-identity, barycentric leverage variables, Bregman/Wasserstein/
  Frechet/BHV literature, and a validation-status row. Extended the Q5
  selected-tail diagnostic with barycentric balance, log leverage, sampling
  scale, and `log(p/n_u)` predictors; the expanded rerun finds that the
  barycentric edge-plus-spectral model reduces median residual-tail absolute
  error to `0.002386` while remaining diagnostic-only.
- Added `raw/assets/benchmark-results/open_question_diagnostic_audit_20260604/open_question_diagnostic_audit.csv`
  and [[open-question-diagnostic-audit-20260604]]. Reran the focused diagnostic
  validation gate, Q10 sibling null-weight rule diagnostic, and Q17 sibling
  projection-dimension rule grid. Updated [[open-mathematical-questions]] with
  a compact all-44-question diagnostic status ledger.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/open_questions/full_diagnostic_contract.py`,
  `tests/validation/71_test_open_question_full_diagnostic_contract.py`, and
  [[open-question-full-diagnostic-contract-20260604]]. Generated
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/open_question_full_diagnostic_contract_20260604/`
  so all `Q1`--`Q44` now have fully specified diagnostic contracts while
  remaining explicitly non-promoted method claims.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/selected_tail_promotion_gate.py`
  and [[selected-tail-promotion-gate-20260604]]. The strict Q1/Q5/Q7/Q8 gate
  over the 2026-06-04 1000-replicate selected-tail run evaluates `79`
  contexts: `69` are `undefined_support_failure`, `10` are
  `external_diagnostic_only`, and `0` are `external_admissible`. The seven
  context-level selected-tail admissible rows remain diagnostic-only because
  Q5 fails leave-one-parent-size-bin transfer and relative c-hat precision is
  not available in the selected-tail context table.
- Added
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/selected_tail_parent_size_balance_stability.py`
  and [[selected-tail-parent-size-balance-stability-20260604]]. On the
  300-replicate row-level selected-geometry table, the diagnostic finds `3`
  balance-scoped, parent-size-stable external-candidate contexts, all
  Gaussian Bernoulli projection-2 high-edge-action rows with balance bins
  `balance_0.1_0.25`, `balance_0.25_0.4`, and `balance_0.4_0.5`; `51`
  contexts remain support failures and `2` lack parent-size holdout coverage.
- Ingested `raw/inbox/traceable-benchmark-suite-request-20260604.txt` and
  added [[traceable-benchmark-suite-request-20260604]] and
  [[traceable-mathematical-benchmark-suite]]. Implemented the first
  `method_proof` benchmark suite with ten traceable cases, lightweight
  generators for the new binary/categorical/continuous/phylogenetic case
  families, and `benchmarks/diagnostics/math_trace/infer_benchmark_math.py`
  for deterministic row-level mathematical failure attribution.
- Ran the canonical full benchmark on 2026-06-05 and added
  [[full-benchmark-run-20260605]]. The run completed `120` cases and `9`
  methods with `1080` result rows in
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260605_084136Z_full/`. Added generator geometry
  coverage for the method-proof cases, a `KL_TE_RUN_DIR` resume/report
  override for the full runner, and a `method_proof` report section so the
  completed CSV could be post-processed into relationship, failure, and PDF
  reports.
- Ran the canonical MNIST example and added
  [[mnist-benchmark-run-20260605]]. The run sampled `2000` MNIST images and
  tested `20` distance/linkage configurations; four single-linkage
  configurations completed with heavy over-splitting and low ARI, while the
  remaining configurations failed closed under the strict sibling empirical-null
  support contract.
- Ran a continuous MNIST PCA50 probe and added
  [[mnist-continuous-pca50-run-20260605]]. The probe retained `83.13%` PCA
  variance, used Euclidean tree distances, and found the best ARI under
  complete linkage (`0.258244`) while single and average linkage collapsed to
  one cluster.
- Ran a focused continuous MNIST PCA50 alpha sweep and added
  [[mnist-continuous-alpha-sweep-20260605]]. The `75`-row grid completed
  without calibration-support or dense-covariance failures; strict Ward
  (`edge_alpha=0.0001`, `sibling_alpha=0.0001`) improved to ARI `0.514854`
  with `11` clusters, while higher alphas over-split the Ward tree.
- Debugged the strict selected-tail promotion gate and added
  [[selected-tail-promotion-gate-debug-20260605]]. The zero-admissible result
  decomposes into `69` support failures plus global Q5 parent-size transfer
  failure and missing c-hat precision metadata; six context-law candidates
  would pass only if both global blockers were relaxed, while the later
  balance-conditioned diagnostic exposes three narrower diagnostic candidates.
- Debugged the Q9/Q10/Q11 internal calibration status and added
  [[internal-calibration-q9-q10-q11-debug-20260605]]. Q9/Q11 support metadata
  and opt-in sparse-context enforcement are implemented. A follow-up threaded
  the enforcement flag and custom thresholds through sibling adjustment,
  sibling annotation, gate annotation, and `TreeDecomposition` while keeping
  defaults off. Q10 remains diagnostic-only because the current
  selected-geometry input lacks internal-support labels.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/internal_support_threshold_validation.py`
  and extended `sibling_null_weight_rule_validation.py` so mixed null/signal
  panels can score permissive/current/strict internal support thresholds and
  Q10 can report selected-nonnull weight leakage when true support labels are
  supplied. No production-scale mixed panel is promoted; the result is
  diagnostic infrastructure for Q9/Q10/Q11 validation.
- Ran mixed internal-calibration sweeps and added
  [[mixed-internal-calibration-sweeps-20260605]]. The method-proof, binary,
  and categorical panels produce `163100`, `225639`, and `58861` Q10 sibling
  records, respectively. Q10 current product-BH selected-nonnull leakage is
  near zero in all three panels, but Q9/Q11 thresholds remain unpromoted
  because categorical admissible null false splits remain above nominal alpha
  and signal retention is low.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/mp_projection_dimension_behavior_sweep.py`,
  ran method-proof, binary, and categorical Q14/Q15/Q17 behavior sweeps, and
  added [[mp-projection-dimension-behavior-sweeps-20260605]]. Raw parent MP
  count often chooses `k=0` and reduces false splits, but in the above-BBP MP
  spike case it also suppresses all signal; floor rules recover signal while
  leaving selected-tree raw sibling p-values anti-conservative. Recorded
  Gavish-Donoho hard singular-value thresholding as diagnostic rank-selection
  input rather than production calibration evidence.
- Debugged the Q14/Q15/Q17 behavior sweep failure mode with post-hoc
  attribution tables. The raw-MP improvement comes primarily from the
  zero-dimensional no-test branch; conditional on `k>0`, null-labeled selected
  sibling tests reject around `99%` of contexts. Required-alpha summaries show
  that nominal `1%` control would require raw p-value cutoffs on the order of
  `1e-113` or smaller, so simple alpha tuning is not a credible production
  calibration.
- Checked Q12/Q13 selected-PCA evidence by rerunning
  `benchmarks.validation.selected_pca_projected_wald_calibration` at 1000
  replicates per setting. The rerun reproduces the locked conclusion:
  leaf-only fixed-membership Gaussian selected PCA is calibrated near nominal
  (`0.046`, `0.048`, `0.059` rejection at alpha `0.05`), while child-mean-row
  spectral bases reject at `0.671`, `0.992`, and `1.000`. Updated
  [[selected-pca-projected-wald-validation]] and Q12/Q13 wording accordingly.

### 2026-06-05

- Recovered historical root-level KAK/cosine spectral scripts from git history
  after confirming they are absent from the current working tree. Added
  [[historical-kak-spectral-pipelines-20260605]] to record that
  `adaptive_cosine_spectral_blocks.py`, `kak_mp_tree_method_test.py`, and
  `cosine_subspace_tree_sweep.py` selected tree topology from spectral
  coordinates before running `TreeDecomposition` gates on the original feature
  matrix, while `kak_signal_adaptive_umap_tree_page.py` was visualization-only.
- Added and ran a current-compatible adaptive cosine/KAK benchmark probe using
  the production gate-bundle path. The method-proof run produced `37` ok and
  `5` fail-closed spectral-block rows; the full run produced `369` ok, `46`
  failed-gate, and `3` failed-spectrum rows. Added
  [[adaptive-cosine-kak-benchmark-probe-20260605]] to record that early
  non-common spectral intervals, especially `2-5` and `2-6`, carry most
  recoverable signal, while common-mode or high-energy block selection is only
  diagnostic without selected-tree calibration.
- Extended the adaptive cosine/KAK probe with explicit internal support
  threshold enforcement and a full-data matrix runner. Support enforcement
  reduced the full benchmark KAK probe from `369` to `248` ok rows and reduced
  cases with an ok block from `110` to `96`. On the combined Julia GO matrix,
  default blocks over-split into `101` to `650` clusters, while all `15`
  binary/TF-IDF blocks failed closed under support-threshold enforcement.

### 2026-06-06

- Restored `scripts/kak_signal_adaptive_umap_tree_page.py` as a
  current-compatible diagnostic page generator for the adaptive cosine/KAK
  matrix probe. The script now writes global/block embeddings, per-gene
  radius/angle/invariant-axis geometry, per-block pages, an interactive 3D
  embedding, and a per-internal-merge tree geometry table.
- Ran the restored diagnostic on the default combined Julia GO matrix KAK
  output. The full render wrote `11` ok block pages and `7722` internal merge
  rows under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/08_full_data_adaptive_kak_signal_umap_tree_page_20260606/`.
  The restored internal geometry reinforces the diagnostic-only conclusion:
  non-common KAK blocks mostly live at high angle to the leading block axis,
  have high independent-radius fractions, and still over-split into many local
  pure fragments without support-enforced selected-tree calibration.
- Tested a candidate path-conditioned barycentric action equation and added
  [[barycentric-action-equation-diagnostic-20260606]]. The selected-tail side
  keeps `q5_barycentric_edge_spectral` as the best current compact equation;
  angle-augmented variants are unstable under feature-family transfer. The KAK
  traversal side shows that radius/angle/internal-axis variables improve
  leave-one-block-out explanation of current local pure fragments, so they are
  traversal diagnostics or future stratifiers rather than direct calibration
  replacements.
- Reran the canonical full benchmark and added [[full-benchmark-run-20260606]].
  The run completed `120` cases and `1080` method rows in
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260605_224254Z_full_big/`, with plots,
  relationship analysis, failure diagnosis, and a merged PDF report. The mean
  ARI leaderboard and KL skip profile match the previous full run: `kmeans`
  leads ok-row mean ARI, `kl` has `92` ok rows and `28` strict-support or dense
  covariance skips, and low-ARI ok `kl` rows are dominated by root-rejection
  under-splits.
- Added [[path-conditioned-barycentric-action-diagnostics-20260606]] after
  implementing cached-output diagnostics for the path-conditioned barycentric
  action trace. The diagnostic reproduces the KAK `radius_angle_action` median
  AUC `0.892810`, reruns the full benchmark in
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260606_path_action_full/`, and ranks angular-shell,
  action-budget, and traversal-survival paths as validation-panel candidates
  while keeping external selected-tail calibration fail-closed.
- Extended the path-conditioned barycentric action diagnostic with row-level
  radius/angle/action annotations and a high-action angular-shell guard panel.
  The panel shows that pure-fragment KAK contexts have higher median capped
  action-budget proxy than mixed contexts, and the best tested guard
  `action_ge_0.9__angle_ge_75__ind_ge_0.85` has pure-fragment precision
  `0.713537` with mixed-context flag rate `0.086202`. This remains a
  post-hoc diagnostic validation-panel candidate, not a production traversal
  rule.
- Added [[null-edge-sibling-calibration-enhancement-plan]] to integrate the
  path-conditioned diagnostics into a null edge and null sibling calibration
  roadmap. The plan keeps edge selected-null calibration, sibling
  selected-tail/internal support calibration, and traversal geometry as
  separate objects with fail-closed production defaults.
- Added a cost-sensitive utility curve to the path-conditioned barycentric
  action diagnostic and wrote
  `benchmarks/results/diagnostics/path_conditioned_barycentric_action_20260606_guard_utility/`.
  The equal-cost best guard is
  `action_ge_0.75__angle_ge_60__ind_ge_0.85` with net utility `744`, while the
  two-times mixed-context-cost best guard is
  `action_ge_0.9__angle_ge_60__ind_ge_0.85` with net utility `197`. No tested
  guard remains net-positive once delaying a mixed context costs `3x` or more
  than preventing a pure fragment.
- Added [[phase1-path-b-foundation-20260606]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/path_b/phase1_path_b_foundation.py`. The full KL-only
  Phase 1 Path B sweep wrote `960` rows over `k_min in {0,1,2,3}` crossed with
  pass-through on/off. The penalized full-suite optimum is `k_min=1` with
  pass-through enabled: penalized mean ARI `0.728301`, ok-row mean ARI
  `0.794510`, skip rate `0.083333`, and exact-k rate `0.736364`. The Q5
  selected-tail geometry gain panel again selects
  `q5_barycentric_edge_spectral`, reducing median residual-tail error by
  `0.260780` versus the no-spectral baseline.
- Added [[recursive-pvalue-geometry-20260606]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/path_b/recursive_pvalue_geometry.py`. The full
  recursive p-value geometry diagnostic completed `110` ok KL cases and `10`
  expected skips. It found connected but asymmetric p-value fields: raw
  edge-vs-parent-sibling coupling `0.392907`, raw recursive sibling continuity
  `0.443386`, raw subspace-rotation-vs-gap coupling `0.254220`, and
  eigen-gap-vs-tail-sensitivity `0.027132`. Raw edge alpha margins pass on
  `0.8372` of edges, while raw sibling margins pass on only `0.0822` of
  sibling contexts, reinforcing that edge traversal and sibling calibration
  must remain separate equations.
- Added [[mixed-null-signal-geometry-validation-20260606]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/path_b/mixed_null_signal_geometry_validation.py`.
  The full labeled panel completed `110` ok KL cases with `26369` sibling
  contexts: `22599` `null_context`, `2366` `mixed_context`, and `1404`
  `signal_context`. Corrected sibling splitting is conservative on clean
  truth-null contexts (`0.002611`) but weak on truth-signal contexts
  (`0.141026`). After adding row-aligned KAK-style radius/angle/action
  covariates in the root selected PCA frame, `kak_radius_angle_action` leads
  the full held-out signal-vs-null panel with median AUC `0.957892`, a gain of
  `0.051982` over `chi_square_only`; the method-proof suite also selects KAK
  with median AUC `0.897334` and gain `0.330447`. These terms remain
  diagnostic-only and are not a production selected-tail calibration rule.
- Extended [[mixed-null-signal-geometry-validation-20260606]] with
  scikit-learn continuous edge/sibling/KAK surfaces and replaced the
  process-randomized `case_hash_modulo_5` split with a stable CRC32 fold id.
  Re-evaluating the cached full labeled panel gives
  `sklearn_hist_gradient_edge_sibling_kak_surface` median AUC `0.985084`,
  `sklearn_logistic_edge_sibling_kak_surface` median AUC `0.966521`, and the
  original row-aligned `kak_radius_angle_action` median AUC `0.948342`, versus
  stable-fold `chi_square_only` median AUC `0.895775`. This supports modeling
  the edge/sibling/KAK relationship as a continuous diagnostic surface before
  any threshold guard or production calibration rule.
- Added [[diagnostic-framework-github-scan-20260606]] after scanning GitHub for
  analytical and machine learning frameworks that could strengthen KL-TE
  calibration diagnostics. No open GitHub issues or PRs were found in the
  project remote for calibration, selected-tail, KAK, FDR, or sibling search
  terms. The useful framework stack is selective-inference formalization,
  simulation-based inference for amortized selected-tail diagnostics, conformal
  risk control for held-out guards, and calibration/observability tooling for
  monitoring and interpretation.
- Debugged KL clustering failure attribution and added
  [[clustering-root-audit-debug-20260606]]. The root sibling decision is stored
  on the root audit row, so the failure and relationship analyzers now read the
  root row instead of root children. Corrected artifacts show `79` accepted-root
  ok KL rows with mean ARI `0.901264`, `13` rejected-root rows with mean ARI
  `0.307692`, and four low-ARI accepted-root post-root sibling traversal
  stalls where deeper sibling split rate is `0.0` despite persistent edge
  action.

### 2026-06-07

- Regenerated the canonical derived reports in
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260605_224254Z_full_big/` after the root-audit
  analyzer fix. The refreshed `benchmark_relationship_*` artifacts,
  `failure_report.md`, `benchmark_relationship_plots.pdf`, and
  `full_benchmark_report.pdf` now use the root-row sibling decision. The
  canonical low-ARI KL diagnosis now separates nine true root rejections from
  four accepted-root post-root sibling traversal stalls.

### 2026-06-10

- Updated [[adaptive-cosine-kak-benchmark-probe-20260605]] with a diagnostic
  visualization rule: when reference labels are available, KAK/cosine tree
  visualizations should order displayed trees or block pages by cluster-level
  NMI so the most informative decompositions are inspected first. This is
  presentation-only and does not change tree construction, gates, traversal, or
  calibration.
- Implemented the NMI-ordering diagnostic in
  `scripts/kak_signal_adaptive_umap_tree_page.py` and reran the restored
  KAK/cosine visualization on the Julia GO matrix with Julia endotype labels.
  The run wrote the sorted page, per-block pages, reference-label table,
  reference NMI/ARI table, and NMI ranking plot under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/08_full_data_adaptive_kak_signal_umap_tree_page_nmi_ordered_20260610/`.
  The top-NMI block was `binary__adaptive_modes_16_19` with NMI `0.632591`,
  ARI `0.002297`, and `650` clusters, confirming that the view is useful for
  inspecting geometry but still reflects severe fragmentation rather than a
  production-selected decomposition.
- Recreated the historical full-matrix comparators with
  `scripts/analysis/run_feature_matrix_with_umap.py` after updating it to the
  current gate-annotation bundle path. Against the same `262` saved Julia
  reference-label matches, fixed diffusion with gates led the recreated
  comparators by ARI (`0.062392`, `54` clusters), followed by paper cosine
  complete `K=20` (`0.058671`, `20` clusters). The high-NMI KAK/KL gate rows
  were near-zero ARI because they split the `703` genes into roughly `650` to
  `670` clusters. The comparison artifacts are under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/09_full_data_method_reference_comparison_20260610/`.
- Added and ran
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/adaptive_cosine_kak_diffusion_matrix_probe.py`
  to test fixed diffusion inside the separated KAK/cosine spectral spaces on
  the Julia GO matrix. The run wrote
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/10_full_data_kak_separated_diffusion_20260610/`.
  It produced `12` ok rows and `3` calibration-support fail-closed rows. The
  best row, `binary__adaptive_modes_02_05`, improved Julia-reference ARI to
  `0.085175` with NMI `0.498510`, but still produced `153` clusters and
  singleton fraction `0.568627`, so separated-space diffusion is a useful
  diagnostic direction rather than a production clustering rule.
- Extended the separated-space diffusion diagnostic with
  `--diffusion-mode adaptive` and reran the Julia GO matrix under the pydiffmap
  variable-bandwidth backend. The adaptive run wrote
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/11_full_data_kak_separated_adaptive_diffusion_20260610/`.
  Its best row was again `binary__adaptive_modes_02_05`, with `130` clusters,
  singleton fraction `0.261538`, NMI `0.516169`, and ARI `0.062483`. Adaptive
  diffusion reduced singleton fragmentation in that block but did not beat the
  fixed separated-space ARI `0.085175`.
- Reran the Julia GO tree comparison under an internal context-quality framing
  that intentionally ignores external Julia ARI. The context report under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/12_context_quality_tree_comparison_20260610/`
  compares non-singleton coverage, medium-size context counts, within-context
  GO Jaccard, and Fisher/BH enrichment fractions. Full adaptive diffusion is
  the strongest broad context tree among tested candidates (`63` clusters,
  `54` non-singleton contexts, `40` medium-size contexts, gene-weighted
  Jaccard `0.143262`, enrichment fraction `0.925926`), while separated
  adaptive TF-IDF `14-30` gives finer but more fragmented high-coherence
  subcontexts.
- Added a conditional subspace-lens analysis that treats full adaptive diffusion
  as the main context tree and compares KAK/cosine block assignments as
  overlays. The report under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/13_subspace_lens_vs_main_adaptive_contexts_20260610/`
  shows that raw KAK `tfidf__adaptive_modes_14_30`, separated fixed diffusion
  `tfidf__adaptive_modes_14_30`, and raw KAK `binary__adaptive_modes_10_15`
  are the strongest refinement lenses, especially for main adaptive context
  `60`.
- Generated the plot-list page under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/14_main_context_subspace_lens_plot_list_20260610/`
  with the main adaptive diffusion embedding/tree, context-quality plots,
  lens-refinement scatter, raw KAK geometry overview, and top subspace-lens
  panels. Updated [[adaptive-cosine-kak-benchmark-probe-20260605]] to record
  that the current decomposition is cosine spectral/KAK-inspired diagnostic
  geometry, not a formal Cartan decomposition unless the symmetry group,
  invariant axis, and selected-subspace calibration law are specified.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/kak_lens_alpha_sweep.py` and ran a
  focused edge/sibling alpha sweep over six useful KAK/cosine diagnostic
  lenses while holding full adaptive diffusion fixed as the main context tree.
  The output under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/15_kak_lens_alpha_sweep_20260610/`
  contains `54` rows: `48` ok and `6` fail-closed gate rows. The sweep shows
  sibling alpha is the main lens-resolution knob, while edge alpha is mostly
  secondary except that `edge_alpha=0.003` breaks empirical-null support for
  two separated-space lenses.

### 2026-06-11

- Extended `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/kak_lens_alpha_sweep.py` with
  average-versus-Ward linkage comparisons for KAK/cosine diagnostic lenses.
  Ward is constrained to Euclidean lens coordinates, not Hamming distances.
  The raw KAK binary `10-15` smoke at `edge_alpha=0.001` and
  `sibling_alpha=0.01` showed average linkage as the useful overlay
  (`101` clusters, singleton-gene fraction `0.022760`, lens score `0.877331`)
  and Ward-Euclidean as an over-fragmenting tree (`638` clusters,
  singleton-gene fraction `0.846373`, lens score `0.190178`).
- Added `benchmarks/cloud/aws_kak_lens_linkage_alpha_sweep.py`, updated the AWS
  benchmark Docker image dependencies, documented the Batch commands in
  `benchmarks/cloud/aws/README.md`, and added
  `tests/validation/82_test_aws_kak_lens_linkage_alpha_sweep.py`. The default
  cloud contract initially covered six lenses, average plus Ward-Euclidean, and
  a `5 x 5` edge/sibling alpha grid. Local two-shard run/merge smoke passed; AWS
  submission remained pending because the local AWS session had expired and
  `aws login` was waiting for browser authentication.
- Added complete linkage to the KAK/cosine lens linkage comparison and reran
  the raw KAK binary `10-15` local smoke with average, complete, and Ward at
  `edge_alpha=0.001`, `sibling_alpha=0.01`. Complete behaved like Ward on this
  lens: `638` clusters, singleton-gene fraction `0.846373`, and lens score
  `0.199089`, compared with average linkage at `101` clusters and score
  `0.877331`. The AWS default contract now covers six lenses, three linkage
  methods, and a `5 x 5` alpha grid for `450` candidate rows.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/covariance_axis_stability.py` and
  `tests/validation/83_test_covariance_axis_stability.py` to test the
  covariance/PCA analogue of the candidate invariant axis. The diagnostic keeps
  genes aligned, resamples feature columns, recomputes centered dual covariance
  sample axes, and aligns replicates by sign and Procrustes. On the Julia
  matrix with `30` replicates and `80%` feature subsampling, median axis-1
  absolute cosine was `0.999692` for binary and `0.999702` for TF-IDF; median
  top-6 subspace canonical correlation was `0.998592` for binary and
  `0.998271` for TF-IDF. Recorded this as stable covariance-axis diagnostic
  evidence, not as a formal Cartan invariant-axis proof.

### 2026-06-12

- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/kak_lens_feature_axis_clustering.py`
  and `tests/validation/84_test_kak_lens_feature_axis_clustering.py` to map
  raw KAK/cosine lens axes back to GO feature loadings using
  \(q_j = Z^T u_j / \sqrt{\lambda_j}\), then cluster genes through the normal
  KL-TE gate path. The diagnostic intentionally accepts only `raw_kak` lenses;
  separated diffusion lenses need separate nonlinear attribution. The Julia
  run under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/20_kak_lens_feature_axis_clustering_20260612/`
  reproduced the raw binary `10-15` `101`-cluster lens with singleton fraction
  `0.022760` and produced a more fragmented raw TF-IDF `14-30` lens with
  `311` clusters and singleton fraction `0.220484`. In both lenses, positive
  regulation of DNA-templated transcription (`GO:0045893`) was the top
  common-to-variant feature bridge.
- Debugged the raw KAK lens feature-axis mapping by adding reconstruction and
  orthogonality audit metrics, then reran the Julia binary `10-15` and TF-IDF
  `14-30` lens mappings under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/21_kak_lens_feature_axis_clustering_debug_20260612/`.
  The largest full feature-axis reconstruction error was `6.55e-15`, so the
  feature-axis map is numerically consistent and the remaining fragmentation is
  traversal/geometric behavior rather than a normalization mismatch.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/tree_strategy_semantic_panel.py`,
  `benchmarks/cloud/aws_tree_strategy_semantic_panel.py`, and
  `tests/validation/85_test_tree_strategy_semantic_panel.py` to join Julia
  tree/lens diagnostics into the requested semantic panel. The local smoke
  under `benchmarks/results/diagnostics/tree_strategy_semantic_panel_smoke_20260612/`
  wrote `59` rows: `2` main-context trees, `37` diagnostic-lens rows, `19`
  fragmentation-lens rows, and `1` coarse baseline row. AWS submission was not
  completed because the local AWS CLI could not reach the AWS sign-in endpoint.
- Corrected the main rectangular tree renderer in
  `kl_clustering_analysis/plot/cluster_tree_visualization.py` to draw routed
  elbow edges instead of straight parent-child diagonals. The crossing-edge
  artifact was a visualization routing problem in deep unbalanced trees, not a
  graph or clustering change. The Plotly subembedding white lines were
  identified as scene grid/axis lines rather than tree edges.
- Completed the full AWS KAK/cosine lens linkage alpha sweep after retrying
  missing shard `0005`; the original array failure was an ECR pull timeout.
  The merged `450`-row output is under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/22_aws_kak_lens_linkage_alpha_sweep_full_20260612/merged/`.
  The regenerated semantic panel is under
  `benchmarks/results/diagnostics/tree_strategy_semantic_panel_aws_full_kak_20260612/`
  and classifies the full joined evidence as `2` main context trees, `149`
  diagnostic lenses, `185` fragmentation lenses, `2` fine lenses, and `1`
  coarse baseline row.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/kak_feature_subspace_clustering.py`
  and `tests/validation/86_test_kak_feature_subspace_clustering.py` to test
  the feature-side interpretation of the KAK route. The diagnostic embeds
  binary GO features, not genes, in each selected raw KAK block as
  `Q_B sqrt(Lambda_B)`. The first Julia binary run under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/23_kak_binary_feature_subspace_clustering_20260612/`
  wrote feature coordinates for all eight adaptive blocks but all blocks failed
  closed in the current gate layer, exposing the missing feature-side
  edge/sibling calibration equations.
- Generated a classical UMAP-only clustering panel for the Julia full-data
  coordinates under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/25_julia_classical_umap_clustering_20260612/`.
  On the stored two-dimensional UMAP plane, complete linkage `K=20` had the
  highest reference ARI (`0.145744`, NMI `0.403709`), with Ward, average,
  GMM, and k-means close behind. This was recorded as a visual manifold
  baseline, not as calibrated tree-context evidence.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/selected_sibling_lrt_diagnostic.py`
  and `tests/validation/87_test_selected_sibling_lrt_diagnostic.py` to compare
  Bernoulli sibling deviance against the existing projected-Wald sibling
  statistic on whole-space fixed-diffusion Julia trees. The diagnostic run
  under
  `benchmarks/results/00_current_20260427_blob_analysis/20260427_blob_analysis/29_selected_sibling_lrt_diagnostic_20260612/`
  shows that the fragmented `k=30,t=3` regime raises median projected-Wald
  selected ratio to `18.603097` while median deviance per changed feature stays
  near `2.010217`, separating topology/projection amplification from raw
  child-distribution contrast.
- Wired the first production-side external selected-tail calibration branch.
  `ExternalSelectedTailCalibrationModel` stores exact pre-promoted contexts and
  returns `external_admissible_scalar` only on exact context matches; otherwise
  it returns `undefined_external_not_admissible`. The sibling adjustment path
  can now use this external model when internal support thresholds fail or when
  no internal empirical-null model can be fit, and gate metadata records whether
  an external selected-tail rule set was active. Focused verification passed:
  `pytest tests/statistics/35_test_empirical_null_inflation_estimation.py -q`,
  `pytest tests/core/test_gate_annotation_reuse.py -q`, and
  `pytest tests/validation/72_test_selected_tail_promotion_gate.py tests/validation/73_test_selected_tail_parent_size_balance_stability.py -q`.
  This is runtime plumbing only; production-scale row-level evidence is still
  required before diagnostic balance-scoped contexts should be promoted.
- Added executable diagnostics for all four null edge/sibling calibration
  roadmap phases: `edge_null_calibration_panel.py`,
  `sibling_null_calibration_panel.py`, `traversal_guard_validation_panel.py`,
  and `production_admissibility_contract.py`, with validation tests
  `88`--`91` and source pages [[edge-null-calibration-panel-20260613]],
  [[sibling-null-calibration-panel-20260613]],
  [[traversal-guard-validation-panel-20260613]], and
  [[production-admissibility-contract-20260613]]. The package separates
  fixed-tree edge nulls, selected-tree edge nulls, sibling strict/stopped/null
  roles, selected-nonnull sibling rows, external selected-tail contexts,
  traversal guard candidates, and final production-admissibility decisions.
  All outputs are diagnostic-only unless a downstream predeclared evidence
  panel supplies production-ready component statuses.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/selected_edge_sibling_null_equation.py`,
  `tests/validation/92_test_selected_edge_sibling_null_equation.py`, and
  [[selected-edge-sibling-null-equation-20260613]]. The diagnostic implements
  the practical conditional equation
  \(P(T_u^{\mathrm{sib}}\ge t\mid f_u,k_u,A_u^{\mathrm{edge}},b_u,\mathrm{edge\ path\ open})\)
  by exact matched empirical-null contexts and add-one tail probabilities.
  Unsupported or sparse matched contexts fail closed rather than producing a
  calibrated p-value.
- Checked the selected edge+sibling equation against current benchmark
  evidence. The stored 2026-06-04 selected-edge pilot sibling artifact cannot
  run the equation because `sibling_raw_stat` and `sibling_raw_p` are entirely
  absent, while live method-proof examples produce conditional empirical
  p-values only in contexts with exact matched strict-null support. The
  production-admissibility contract now treats those finite equation p-values
  as diagnostic-only and sparse/unmatched equation contexts as fail-closed.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/statistic_distribution_shape_panel.py`,
  `tests/validation/93_test_statistic_distribution_shape_panel.py`, and
  [[statistic-distribution-shape-panel-20260613]]. The panel compares empirical
  statistic skew/tails against the chi-square skew implied by current df and an
  optional covariance-inferred Satterthwaite df/scale reference. Live
  method-proof sibling rows showed covariance-inferred effective df almost
  unchanged from current projection df, but large covariance scales that reduce
  tail rates without restoring nominal calibration. This makes df count alone
  unlikely to explain the observed distribution mismatch.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/covariance_laplacian_panel.py`,
  `tests/validation/94_test_covariance_laplacian_panel.py`, and
  [[covariance-laplacian-panel-20260613]]. The panel turns covariance matrices
  into absolute-correlation Laplacian graphs. Live method-proof checks showed
  all sampled Bernoulli sibling contrast covariance matrices are diagonal
  Laplacian graphs, while reconstructed parent spectral covariance matrices are
  dense and mostly connected. This records a wiki coverage gap: prior pages
  covered MP eigenvalues, selected-tail spectral covariates, and covariance
  validation, but not covariance graph connectivity or the separation between
  sibling whitening covariance and parent spectral covariance.
- Updated `benchmarks/validation/selected_edge_type1_geometry.py` so future
  selected-edge sibling artifacts export raw sibling statistic, raw p-value,
  adjusted statistic/p-value when available, covariance-inferred df/scale, and
  bounded Laplacian summaries for sibling contrast and parent spectral
  covariance. Raw sibling rows are collected before decomposition adjustment,
  so calibration-support failures can still be inspected by the distribution
  and selected edge+sibling equation panels.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/selected_edge_sibling_postrun_analysis.py`,
  `tests/validation/95_test_selected_edge_sibling_postrun_analysis.py`, and
  [[selected-edge-sibling-postrun-analysis-20260613]]. A local two-replicate
  `binary_2clusters` selected-tree smoke run produced `196` edge rows, `98`
  sibling rows, and `2` final rows. Current chi-square sibling tails remained
  inflated at tail rate `1.0` in both df bins; covariance-inferred alternate
  tail rates dropped to about `0.158` and `0.864`; the selected edge+sibling
  equation produced `95` supported conditional empirical p-values and withheld
  `3` rows for insufficient null support.
- Extended the selected-edge sibling post-run analyzer so it writes
  `production_admissibility_components.csv` and
  `production_admissibility_summary.csv` through the same conservative
  production-admissibility contract. On the local two-replicate
  `binary_2clusters` smoke artifact, the summary has `7` required components,
  `3` fail-closed blockers, and `4` diagnostic-only components, with final
  decision `fail_closed_undefined`. The blockers are the two
  `skew_exceeds_df_reference` distribution-shape bins and
  `selected_edge_sibling_equation:insufficient_null_support`.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/differential_statistic_validity_panel.py`,
  `tests/validation/96_test_differential_statistic_validity_panel.py`, and
  [[differential-statistic-validity-panel-20260613]]. The panel reconstructs
  the implemented whitened sibling contrast and parent PCA projection, then
  reports Fisher/Wald boundary geometry, fixed-projection finite differences,
  recomputed-projection sensitivity, eigengap instability, and nonsmooth
  Hamming selection stability. A one-replicate `binary_2clusters` fixed-tree
  plus selected-tree smoke produced `98` rows: `81`
  `wald_metric_boundary_unstable`, `11` `fixed_subspace_candidate`, and `6`
  `nonsmooth_selection_geometry`. The production summary had `4` required
  components, all fail-closed, with final decision `fail_closed_undefined`.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/regularized_wald_statistic_panel.py`,
  `tests/validation/97_test_regularized_wald_statistic_panel.py`, and
  [[regularized-wald-statistic-panel-20260613]]. The panel compares plug-in,
  Jeffreys-smoothed, Dirichlet-smoothed, and root-shrunk sibling
  projected-Wald statistics before any production promotion. In a five-
  replicate `binary_2clusters` fixed-tree smoke, smoothing reduced boundary
  instability to zero for Jeffreys, Dirichlet, and root-shrink variants, but
  fixed-tree chi-square tail rates still ranged from `0.500` to `0.933`.
  The selected-tree smoke had smoothed tail rates `0.969`--`1.000`. Both
  production summaries remained `fail_closed_undefined`.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/null_law_decomposition_panel.py`,
  `tests/validation/98_test_null_law_decomposition_panel.py`, and
  [[null-law-decomposition-panel-20260613]]. The panel separates fixed-topology
  sibling null behavior into same-sample adaptive projection, independent
  tree-sample projection, and random fixed orthonormal projection. In a
  20-replicate `binary_2clusters` smoke, same-sample adaptive projection had
  tail rates `0.916` and `0.745` across the two df bins, while independent
  tree-sample projection had `0.053` and `0.076`, and random fixed projection
  had `0.063` and `0.036`. Projection row orthonormality and operator weights
  stayed at the fixed-subspace chi-square values, so the null-law failure is
  same-sample adaptive projection/dimension selection rather than the
  quadratic form itself. The production summary remains
  `fail_closed_undefined`.
- Recorded the user constraint that cross-fit/sample-split methods are not the
  intended next production path. Added `raw/inbox/toomanycells-method-notes-20260613.md`
  and [[toomanycells-method-20260613]] after checking the TooManyCells public
  documentation and publication references. The note is relational, not a
  direct comparator: TooManyCells is recorded as a tree-first divisive
  hierarchical spectral clustering method with Newman-Girvan modularity
  stopping. It is not a repair for the current KL-TE projected-Wald null law and
  not a proposed replacement for the KL-TE gate.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/data_independent_sibling_gate_panel.py`,
  `tests/validation/99_test_data_independent_sibling_gate_panel.py`,
  `raw/inbox/data-independent-sibling-gate-smoke-20260613.md`, and
  [[data-independent-sibling-gate-panel-20260613]]. The panel implements a
  same-data, non-cross-fit candidate that removes adaptive parent PCA/dimension
  selection from the sibling statistic and uses fixed coordinate-wise
  Bonferroni/BH p-values with a selected-topology penalty. In the
  `binary_2clusters` 50-replicate selected-topology smoke, null effective-alpha
  rejection was `0.007755` against target `0.01`, signal rejection was
  `0.175510` to `0.194694`, and large-parent signal rejection was `0.738019`.
  Production admissibility remains `diagnostic_only`.
- Extended the data-independent sibling gate panel to evaluate a
  selected-topology penalty grid, support direct categorical cases with
  `FeatureSpace` metadata, emit
  `data_independent_sibling_gate_penalty_transfer_summary.csv`, and scope
  production-admissibility contracts by method, penalty, topology mode, and
  feature family. Added `raw/inbox/data-independent-sibling-gate-transfer-20260613.md`.
  In a three-case binary transfer smoke, `coordinate_bh` with penalty `10` was
  the only grid candidate controlling all selected-null cases while retaining
  all signal cases under the all-parent threshold. A direct categorical smoke
  remained null-conservative but signal-weak, leaving categorical aggregation
  and traversal-target power as open work.
- Added `block_bonferroni` and `block_bh` candidate methods to the
  data-independent sibling gate panel. These aggregate fixed feature-block
  chi-square p-values instead of individual coordinates, using the categorical
  simplex chart dimension as degrees of freedom. A categorical block-gate smoke
  over `cat_clear_3cat_4c`, `cat_mod_3cat_4c`, and
  `cat_highcard_10cat_4c` stayed null-conservative but signal-weak; the best
  minimum all-parent signal rejection was `0.033166` for block BH and
  `0.049580` for coordinate BH. This rules out simple categorical block
  aggregation as the missing fix.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/data_independent_sibling_gate_traversal_panel.py`,
  `tests/validation/100_test_data_independent_sibling_gate_traversal_panel.py`,
  `raw/inbox/data-independent-sibling-gate-traversal-20260613.md`, and
  [[data-independent-sibling-gate-traversal-panel-20260613]]. The panel runs
  fixed data-independent sibling gates through the actual top-down traversal.
  In an eight-replicate six-case smoke, fixed `coordinate_bh` gates recovered
  strong signal ARI for binary and direct categorical cases, but selected-null
  traversal still false-split above the diagnostic threshold. The remaining
  blocker is selected topology plus edge-reachable traversal null control, not
  same-sample adaptive sibling projection.
- Extended the data-independent sibling gate traversal panel with split-geometry
  diagnostics and
  `data_independent_sibling_gate_traversal_transfer_summary.csv`. A mixed
  16-replicate smoke with edge alpha `0.0001` and penalties `500` and `1000`
  showed binary transfer candidates with max null false-split rate `0.0000`
  and minimum signal mean ARI at least `0.987067`; direct categorical transfer
  still failed because high-cardinality null false splits persisted and
  moderate categorical signal weakened at stronger penalties. A 128-replicate
  `cat_highcard_10cat_4c` geometry follow-up estimated false splitting at
  `7/128 = 0.0546875`, all at the selected root with first child size `9`--`44`
  out of `200`. The matching signal run had mean ARI `0.755123` and first root
  min-child size at least `48`, but other valid signal cases have smaller first
  splits, so the evidence supports selective/adaptive traversal-null
  conditioning rather than a universal hard balance guard.
- Added an optional selected-root permutation diagnostic to the same traversal
  panel. It preserves Bernoulli/categorical feature-block margins, reruns
  selected tree construction on permuted null samples, and reports a
  Monte-Carlo selected-root p-value for the fixed sibling gate. In a
  four-replicate `cat_highcard_10cat_4c` smoke with `9` permutation draws, the
  known false root changed from raw p-value `1.707e-6` to selected-root
  p-value `0.1`, but true signal roots also had selected-root p-values
  `0.1`--`0.2`. This makes permutation conditioning a useful selected-null
  diagnostic but not yet a power-preserving production stopping statistic.
- Extended the traversal panel to emit
  `production_admissibility_components.csv` and
  `production_admissibility_summary.csv` from traversal transfer evidence. A
  small contract smoke over `binary_2clusters` and `cat_highcard_10cat_4c` at
  penalty `1000` produced the intended conservative boundary: binary
  fixed-coordinate transfer is represented as `diagnostic_only`, while
  categorical high-cardinality transfer remains `fail_closed_undefined`. This
  turns the non-cross-fit repair into an explicit domain-scoped candidate
  without promoting it beyond the available evidence.
- Added optional selected-root feature-subsample stability diagnostics and a
  root-stability guard to the data-independent traversal panel. The diagnostic
  rebuilds selected trees on feature-block subsamples and compares root
  bipartitions by ARI. In a 16-replicate `cat_highcard_10cat_4c` smoke, a
  threshold of `0.08` blocked the one null false root, reduced false-split rate
  from `0.0625` to `0.0`, and blocked no signal roots; signal mean ARI stayed
  `0.824357`. In a six-case mixed smoke the guard controlled all tested nulls
  and preserved binary transfer, but categorical transfer remained signal-weak
  because `cat_mod_3cat_4c` stayed below the `0.75` signal threshold. The best
  categorical penalty/edge follow-up reached minimum signal mean ARI `0.747419`
  while keeping null false-split rate `0.0`.
- Ran a follow-up threshold sweep for the root-stability guard. With fixed
  coordinate BH, edge alpha `0.001`, selected-topology penalty `50`,
  feature-subsample fraction `0.8`, `12` stability subsamples, and
  root-stability threshold `0.15`, the 16-replicate six-case mixed smoke
  transferred across binary and direct categorical cases. Binary max null
  false-split rate was `0.0` with minimum signal mean ARI `0.865005`;
  categorical max null false-split rate was `0.0` with minimum signal mean ARI
  `0.771764`. Production summaries remain `diagnostic_only`, but the current
  method candidate is now explicit: fixed coordinate BH plus selected-topology
  penalty plus selected-root feature-subsample stability.
- Added confidence-bound transfer diagnostics to the data-independent traversal
  panel. Case summaries now include Wilson upper confidence bounds for null
  false-split rates and one-sided t lower confidence bounds for signal mean
  ARI; production-admissibility rows include separate point-transfer and
  confidence-bound components. In the 16-replicate candidate smoke, point
  estimates still transferred, but both binary and categorical confidence
  components failed closed because zero observed false splits still produced a
  null false-split upper confidence bound of `0.193608`, above the `0.05`
  target. This keeps the candidate diagnostic-only until a larger validation
  run or analytic selected-null bound tightens the uncertainty.
- Added validation-support sizing to traversal transfer summaries. For the
  current 95% Wilson bound and a `0.05` false-split target, zero observed false
  splits require `73` null replicates per case. The 16-replicate candidate
  smoke therefore needs `57` additional zero-false-split null replicates per
  case before the null confidence component can pass, with separate signal
  lower-bound validation still required.
- Ran the 73-replicate mixed candidate validation at root-stability threshold
  `0.15`. Point-transfer still passed, but confidence failed because null false
  splits appeared in `binary_2clusters`, `cat_clear_3cat_4c`, and
  `cat_mod_3cat_4c`; both binary and categorical family summaries had max null
  false-split rate `0.027397` and null upper confidence `0.094501`. Added
  `root_stability_threshold_sensitivity.csv` to the traversal panel. Post-run
  sensitivity on the same evidence identified threshold `0.24` as the first
  tested value passing both binary and categorical point/confidence checks:
  max null false split `0.0`, null upper confidence `0.049992`, binary signal
  lower confidence `0.762835`, and categorical signal lower confidence
  `0.758985`. This is a prospective-validation candidate, not a production
  constant, because the threshold was selected after inspecting the run.
- Ran the pre-alignment prospective 73-replicate validation with root-stability
  threshold `0.24` predeclared. The fixed coordinate BH +
  selected-topology penalty `50` + root-stability guard candidate passed point
  and confidence checks on the six-case binary/direct-categorical smoke suite.
  Binary max null false-split rate was `0.0`, null upper confidence
  `0.049992`, minimum signal mean ARI `0.835616`, and minimum signal lower
  confidence `0.762835`. Direct categorical max null false-split rate was
  `0.0`, null upper confidence `0.049992`, minimum signal mean ARI `0.782621`,
  and minimum signal lower confidence `0.758985`. The production contract still reports
  `diagnostic_only`, because candidate statuses are intentionally not
  production-ready without broader generalization or threshold derivation.
- Added a relational TooManyCells check and broader fixed-gate stress probes.
  TooManyCells is recorded only as a tree-first divisive spectral reference
  with Newman-Girvan modularity stopping, not as a direct KL-TE comparator. The
  full supported traversal surface contains 42 binary-template and 11 direct
  categorical-multinomial cases, but all-surface inline runs need checkpointed
  output before they are practical. Three-replicate targeted probes with the
  same fixed-gate constants found zero observed null false splits in targeted
  binary and direct categorical cases. Binary signal retained across seven
  targeted cases with minimum mean ARI `0.805955`; direct categorical signal
  failed because `cat_highcard_20cat_4c` had mean ARI `0.080649` and
  `cat_overlap_3cat_4c` had mean ARI `0.703263`. The next method problem is
  categorical power without reopening selected-root null inflation.
- Added checkpoint row output and selected-tree oracle ARI to the traversal
  panel. Checkpoints are written after every completed case-role-replicate
  unit, preserving partial evidence from broad validation runs. The oracle
  diagnostic shows that `cat_highcard_20cat_4c` is limited by the selected
  average-linkage tree itself: low-penalty `block_bh` reaches mean ARI
  `0.659781`, equal to the selected-tree oracle cut at the true cluster count,
  while edge alpha `0.01` does not improve the case. This moves the remaining
  categorical issue from sibling projection calibration to categorical tree
  construction or oracle-normalized validation.
- Added production-facing fixed-subspace sibling gate options:
  `sibling_gate_method="fixed_coordinate_bh"` and
  `sibling_gate_method="fixed_block_bh"`. These options are wired through
  `run_gate_annotation_pipeline`, `TreeDecomposition`, and `PosetTree.decompose`
  via forwarded kwargs. The default remains `projected_wald_inflation`. The new
  fixed gates compute covariance-whitened sibling contrasts and apply
  predeclared coordinate-wise or feature-block BH aggregation without using
  same-sample parent PCA projections or edge-derived sibling projection
  dimensions. Regression tests cover opt-in annotation, method metadata,
  categorical block aggregation, and cache invalidation across sibling-gate
  methods.
- Refactored the diagnostic BH fixed-gate p-value paths to delegate to the
  production `fixed_subspace_sibling_p_value` implementation. Added regression
  coverage proving that `fixed_coordinate_bh` does not call the parent-PCA
  sibling input resolver. This aligns the validation evidence with the
  production-facing method option and locks the main repair invariant into
  tests.
- Added `sibling_gate_alpha_penalty` to the gate annotation and decomposition
  path. The penalty is positive, defaults to `1.0`, is stored in gate config
  metadata, and divides `sibling_alpha` before sibling FDR. Tests cover
  effective alpha calculation, invalid penalties, and cache invalidation across
  penalty changes. An end-to-end `binary_2clusters` smoke with
  `fixed_coordinate_bh`, penalty `50`, edge alpha `0.001`, and sibling alpha
  `0.01` wrote `49` fixed-method sibling rows and `5` open sibling rows.
- Added the selected-root feature-subsample stability guard to the
  production-facing annotation and decomposition path. The guard is default
  off, records its threshold/subsampling settings in gate config metadata, and
  closes only an unstable open root by rewriting the root sibling decision to
  fail closed with `Root_Stability_*` diagnostics. Tests cover direct blocking,
  metadata capture, invalid inert guard configuration, and cache invalidation
  across guard changes. The runnable opt-in method now matches the diagnostic
  candidate: fixed-subspace sibling gate plus selected-topology alpha penalty
  plus selected-root stability guard, while production promotion remains gated
  by the admissibility contract.
- Added `fixed_global_chi_square` as the direct full fixed-subspace sibling
  gate. The statistic is `chi2.sf(z.T @ z, df=len(z))` on the existing
  covariance-whitened contrast, so it avoids parent PCA projection rows and
  edge-derived sibling dimensions while preserving the classical fixed-df Wald
  reference. Diagnostic panels expose the same option as
  `candidate_method="global_chi_square"`. A two-replicate `binary_2clusters`
  traversal smoke with penalty `50` and root-stability threshold `0.24` wrote
  all expected artifacts and produced point-transfer evidence, but production
  admissibility remained fail-closed because confidence was still
  null-uncertain at that sample size.
- Added named sibling-gate profiles `fixed_coordinate_guarded_v1` and
  `fixed_global_guarded_v1`. These profiles package the non-cross-fit fixed
  sibling gate, selected-topology penalty `50`, root-stability threshold
  `0.24`, `12` stability subsamples, feature fraction `0.8`, and deterministic
  seed `0` as auditable diagnostic candidates. The profile id is stored in
  gate annotation config metadata and included in cache reuse checks. Tests
  verify profile resolution, conflict detection, avoidance of parent-PCA
  sibling inputs, and recomputation when a cached adaptive bundle is reused
  under a fixed profile request.
- Wired fixed sibling-gate profiles through the shared KL benchmark runner.
  `_run_kl_method` and `_run_kl_on_distance` now forward profile/fixed-gate
  settings into gate annotation and decomposition and record them in
  `MethodRunResult.extra`. Added a runner regression for
  `fixed_global_guarded_v1`. The method-constants manifest now includes the
  fixed-profile constants `sibling_gate_profile`,
  `fixed_sibling_gate_alpha_penalty`, `root_stability_guard_threshold`,
  `root_stability_subsample_replicates`, and
  `root_stability_feature_fraction` as explicit validation targets; their
  skeleton evidence status remains `missing` until profile validation artifacts
  are attached.
- Added
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/fixed_sibling_gate_profile_validation.py`,
  `tests/validation/101_test_fixed_sibling_gate_profile_validation.py`,
  `raw/inbox/fixed-sibling-gate-profile-validation-20260613.md`, and
  [[fixed-sibling-gate-profile-validation-20260613]]. The panel validates named
  fixed sibling-gate profiles through the shared KL runner, records whether
  adaptive projected-Wald sibling rows were avoided, writes method-constant
  evidence fields, and emits conservative production-admissibility components.
  TooManyCells remains relational context only, not a direct comparator.
- Fixed the production-facing root-stability guard replay contract. The guard
  now records root replay distance metric and linkage method in gate config
  metadata and recomputes feature-subsample roots with the same Hamming/average
  contract used by the shared KL fixed-profile runner, instead of falling back
  to default Euclidean linkage replay. Focused tests cover metadata propagation,
  cache invalidation, runner extras, and profile-validation output columns.
- Aligned the data-independent sibling-gate traversal diagnostic with the same
  Hamming/average selected-tree replay contract. Selected trees, oracle cuts,
  root-selective p-values, and root feature-subsample stability now use
  explicit Hamming distance; row outputs and the manifest record the metric and
  linkage. Previous traversal numbers from before this correction should be
  treated as pre-alignment diagnostics unless rerun with these fields.
- Ran corrected Hamming/average traversal evidence for the fixed coordinate
  candidate. The 16-replicate six-case mixed smoke was a point-transfer
  candidate but confidence-uncertain. The 73-replicate support run remained a
  point-transfer candidate and signal confidence passed, but binary and direct
  categorical families each had one null false root (`1/73`, Wilson upper
  `0.073597`), so production admissibility stayed fail-closed. The traversal
  summary now reports observed-count-aware support sizing: with one false
  split, `110` total null replicates, or `37` additional zero-false null
  replicates, are needed to bring the Wilson upper bound below `0.05`. A
  corrected penalty-grid probe showed penalty `500` weakens categorical signal,
  so the evidence does not justify replacing the current penalty `50` profile
  constant.
- Added `root_selective_guard_sensitivity.csv` to the traversal panel. The
  diagnostic estimates a selected-root permutation guard that blocks opened
  roots whose selected-root p-value exceeds `sibling_alpha`. Targeted 99-draw
  checks on the corrected-Hamming false roots blocked the two null roots while
  retaining matched strong signal roots at the Monte Carlo floor; a nine-draw
  smoke was too coarse and blocked signal. This identifies selected-root
  permutation as the next method layer to validate, not a production default.
- Made selected-root permutation lazy in the traversal panel: all rows keep the
  observed root p-value, but expensive permutation draws are run only for
  opened or root-stability-blocked roots. Regression coverage verifies the lazy
  call pattern, and a 99-draw binary false-root smoke still writes the expected
  selected-root guard sensitivity artifact.
- Exposed the fixed coordinate-BH p-value as a direct helper so diagnostic
  selected-root permutation loops no longer rebuild a throwaway Bernoulli
  `FeatureSpace` for each coordinate-BH p-value. Focused validation confirms
  equality with the production fixed-subspace gate and statsmodels BH
  adjustment.
- Aligned the traversal diagnostic with production-facing fixed profiles by
  adding explicit `root_stability_seed` support, defaulting to `0`. The
  fixed-profile validation rows now record root-level sibling p-values,
  root-open status, root-stability mean/median/q10, and root-stability block
  status. An aligned replay at data seed `20309045` shows that
  `fixed_coordinate_guarded_v1` blocks the known binary null root but still
  opens the known direct-categorical null root; the 99-draw selected-root
  permutation diagnostic blocks that categorical false root while retaining the
  matched signal. Production summaries remain fail-closed because this is
  targeted evidence, not broad confidence evidence.

### 2026-06-14

- Exposed selected-root permutation as a production-facing, default-off runtime
  guard for fixed-subspace sibling gates. The guard preserves
  Bernoulli/categorical feature-block margins, reruns Hamming/average selected
  tree construction under permutation, records `Root_Selective_Permutation_*`
  audit columns, and closes only an open root whose selected-root p-value is
  above the guard alpha. It is intentionally rejected for
  `projected_wald_inflation`, because the same-sample adaptive PCA statistic is
  the invalid layer being avoided.
- Threaded the guard through `run_gate_annotation_pipeline`,
  `TreeDecomposition`, shared KL runner extras, gate annotation cache metadata,
  fixed-profile validation rows, summaries, method-constant evidence fields,
  and validation tests. Added method-constant targets for
  `root_selective_permutation_guard_replicates` and
  `root_selective_permutation_guard_alpha`.
- Ran a targeted runtime replay with `fixed_coordinate_guarded_v1`, data seed
  `20309045`, guard seed `20318458`, and `99` permutation draws. The known
  `cat_clear_3cat_4c` null root is now closed in the runtime profile path
  (`selected-root p = 0.17`, one final cluster), while the matched categorical
  signal is retained (`selected-root p = 0.01`, ARI `0.881909`). The known
  `binary_2clusters` null remains closed by root stability, with selected-root
  permutation also indicating a block (`p = 0.02`).
- Updated the raw notes and wiki synthesis to reflect the new boundary: the
  specific rooting/null-sibling artifact now has an executable non-cross-fit
  guard, but production promotion remains fail-closed until broad null
  confidence, signal confidence, guard replicate/alpha validation, and
  supported feature-family/tree-construction domains are established.
- Packaged the selected-root method layer as
  `fixed_coordinate_selective_root_v1`. The profile expands to fixed
  coordinate BH, selected-topology penalty `50`, root-stability threshold
  `0.24`, `12` stability subsamples, feature fraction `0.8`, selected-root
  permutation replicates `99`, seed `0`, and guard alpha `0.01`. Existing
  guarded profiles keep selected-root permutation disabled by default but still
  accept explicit guard settings for targeted replay. The shared KL runner now
  records resolved profile settings in `MethodRunResult.extra`, so validation
  artifacts report the actual method constants that ran.
- Updated fixed-profile method-constant evidence to use resolved profile
  settings. A profile-owned selected-root guard is now reported as enabled in
  evidence JSON even when the CLI guard override arguments are left at their
  defaults; the selective-root profile smoke records replicate grid `[99]` and
  alpha grid `[0.01]`.
- Rechecked the rooting/null-sibling boundary after the selected-root fix.
  Root-only guarding still leaves a `cat_clear_3cat_4c` pass-through
  descendant false split in the six-case two-replicate smoke. A broad
  `open_internal` selected-subtree guard closes nulls but weakens signal
  (`0.651330` binary mean signal ARI, `0.521072` categorical). Added the
  narrower `fixed_coordinate_selective_passthrough_v1` profile, which tests
  only descendant splits reached through an ordinary closed sibling ancestor
  and avoids compounding below explicit root guards. The v2 mixed smoke has
  zero observed null false splits, binary mean signal ARI `0.941101`, and
  categorical mean signal ARI `0.848463`; production remains fail-closed on
  smoke-scale confidence (`0.65762` null Wilson upper bound).
- Added `root_selective_permutation_guard_scope` as an explicit
  method-constant validation target and regenerated the method-constant
  manifest skeleton. Fixed-profile evidence now reports a `scope_grid`, so
  `root`, `open_internal`, and `passthrough_descendant` guard choices are
  auditable.
- Added Wilson support sizing to fixed-profile transfer summaries and
  manifest-style evidence. The two-replicate
  `fixed_coordinate_selective_passthrough_v1` mixed smoke now reports `73`
  required zero-false-split null replicates per case and `71` additional
  zero-false null replicates from the current support level. Fixed checkpoint
  resume to read CSVs with `keep_default_na=False`, preserving the literal
  `null` role in resumed rows so null confidence calculations are not dropped.
- Rechecked `fixed_coordinate_selective_passthrough_v1` on a six-case
  ten-replicate mixed run. Categorical nulls stayed closed, but
  `binary_many_clusters` null replicate `7` produced a pass-through descendant
  false split below an already closed unstable root. A hard closed-root
  pass-through barrier was rejected because it collapses two strong
  many-cluster signal rows from ARI `1.0` to `0.0`, and increasing the local
  selected-subtree permutation count to `999` still leaves the false row
  selected at p-value `0.002`. Diagnostic global selected-family replays move
  that false row to p-values around `0.05` to `0.06`, identifying the next
  non-cross-fit fix as an optimized global pass-through selected-family null,
  not a production constant change in this pass.
- Implemented the global selected-family pass-through null as
  `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_v1`. The new
  `global_sibling_min_passthrough_descendant` scope keeps selected-root
  permutation for roots and evaluates pass-through descendants against the
  minimum fixed-subspace sibling p-value over every binary parent in each
  fully reselected feature-block permutation null tree. A targeted
  `binary_many_clusters` replay closes null replicate `7` with selected p
  `0.05` and retains signal replicate `0` at ARI `1.0` with selected p
  `0.01`; the profile remains diagnostic because broad transfer and runtime
  optimization are still open.
- Added an exact Bernoulli fast path for the global selected-family
  fixed-coordinate BH statistic. The known false-row CLI replay now runs in
  about `16` seconds while preserving selected p `0.05`. Small transfer
  smokes are favorable but still confidence-limited:
  `/tmp/klte_global_passthrough_binary_10rep_20260614` has zero false splits
  across `30` binary null rows and signal mean ARI `0.945084`, while
  `/tmp/klte_global_passthrough_categorical_10rep_20260614` has zero false
  splits across `30` categorical null rows and signal mean ARI `0.832022`.
  Production remains fail-closed because Wilson confidence still needs
  additional zero-false null support; at this point categorical runtime still
  used the canonical covariance fallback, which was rechecked and optimized in
  the next pass.
- Rechecked the remaining fixed-profile elements and replaced the categorical
  fallback in the selected-family path with exact vectorized grouped
  multinomial whitening through `compute_whitened_wald_contrast`. The hard
  `binary_many_clusters` null seed replay remains closed with one cluster,
  selected-family p `0.05`, and scope
  `global_sibling_min_passthrough_descendant`. The rerun
  `/tmp/klte_global_passthrough_categorical_10rep_fast_20260614` preserves the
  prior direct-categorical smoke result, with zero false splits across `30`
  null rows and signal mean ARI `0.832022`, while wall time improves from about
  `309` seconds to about `147` seconds. Production remains fail-closed because
  support confidence still needs `63` additional zero-false null replicates per
  case; the remaining runtime issue is the repeated selected-family
  permutation loop, not categorical covariance object construction.
- Ran binary support-level validation for
  `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_v1` on `binary_2clusters`,
  `binary_many_clusters`, and `binary_unbalanced_low`. The first two cases
  have zero false splits through `142` null replicates each, but
  `binary_unbalanced_low` has three false splits, point false-split rate
  `0.021127`, and Wilson upper bound `0.060270`, so the confidence component
  remains fail-closed. All three false rows are pass-through descendants below
  closed roots and land on the `99`-draw selected-family p-value floor `0.01`.
  A `999`-draw replay gives p-values `0.017`, `0.005`, and `0.029`.
  Implemented the diagnostic successor
  `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1`, which reruns global
  pass-through floor cases at `999` draws. Normal-runner replay closes two of
  the three observed false rows and keeps the genuinely stronger row with
  p-value `0.005`. The refined ten-replicate binary smoke has zero false
  splits across `30` null rows and signal mean ARI `0.945084`, but remains
  diagnostic until full support validation is run.
- Completed binary support-level validation for
  `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1` on the same three binary
  transfer cases at `142` null/signal replicates per case. The refined profile
  has one false split across `426` null rows, the known
  `binary_unbalanced_low` replicate `96` with selected-family p-value `0.005`;
  the `binary_unbalanced_low` Wilson upper bound is `0.038809`, and the
  minimum signal mean ARI lower confidence across cases is `0.832434`. The
  production summary moves from `fail_closed_undefined` to `diagnostic_only`:
  confidence is now a candidate for the binary transfer set, while profile
  routing, transfer, and confidence components remain diagnostic-only pending
  broader method acceptance and direct-categorical support evidence.
- Ran the all-supported selected-null smoke and full 120-case single-seed
  performance pass for `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1`; added
  `raw/inbox/refined-profile-all-benchmark-tests-20260614.md` and
  [[refined-profile-all-benchmark-tests-20260614]]. The selected-null smoke
  covered all 53 regenerable full-suite binary/direct-categorical cases with
  three null/signal replicates each. Direct categorical nulls stayed closed,
  but binary-template overlap nulls produced 11 false splits across 126 null
  rows, so all-supported production remains fail-closed. The full 120-case
  performance pass returned 107 ok rows and 13 continuous covariance-contract
  errors; ok rows had mean ARI `0.782567`, median ARI `0.955719`, and exact-K
  rate `0.439252`. The result keeps the refined profile diagnostic-only and
  identifies overlap-template null inflation, weak heavy-overlap/SBM/
  Dirichlet/deep-traversal signal, and continuous covariance support as the
  next blockers.
- Added `raw/inbox/root-selection-literature-20260614.md` and
  [[root-selection-literature-20260614]] after a literature check on root
  selection, hierarchical-clustering significance, TooManyCells, divisive
  high-dimensional split objectives, phylogenetic rooting, and trajectory-root
  orientation. The synthesis separates KL-TE's selected all-sample root split
  from biological or phylogenetic root orientation and records that the current
  method issue is selected-root/traversal null validity, not optimizing a free
  high-dimensional root point.
- Added `raw/inbox/selected-root-selected-family-traversal-literature-20260614.md`
  and [[selected-root-selected-family-traversal-literature-20260614]] after a
  focused literature check for the selected-root/selected-family traversal null
  law. The synthesis records that no exact KL-TE law was found, but the closest
  technical relatives are selective inference after hierarchical clustering,
  selective inference on multiple selected families, hierarchical FDR/FWER,
  TreeScan and scan-statistic max tests, and cluster-based permutation
  max-statistic methods. The current refined global pass-through diagnostic is
  best interpreted as a TreeScan/maxT-style selected-family permutation object
  for a data-selected hierarchy.
- Materialized a clean selected-root/pass-through null failure fixture under
  `raw/assets/failure-fixtures/selected-root-pass-through-null-20260614/` and
  added [[selected-root-pass-through-null-fixture-20260614]]. The fixture uses
  iid Bernoulli null data with `400` samples, `80` features, and seed
  `20310054`; replaying `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1`
  returns three clusters even though the root is closed by stability. The
  compact decision path records root `N798` closed with raw root sibling
  p-value `6.72e-6`, and descendant `N797` open with sibling p-value
  `5.21e-7`.
- Added
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/selected_family_traversal_panel.py`,
  `tests/validation/102_test_selected_family_traversal_panel.py`, and
  [[selected-family-traversal-panel-20260614]]. The panel compares baseline KL
  traversal with fixed-coordinate selected-root, local pass-through, and
  refined global selected-family profiles, writes selected-family guard rows,
  and emits multi-scale node, region, and sample outputs so stable boundaries,
  blocked selected families, pass-through zones, and leaf fragments are
  inspectable separately from the flat cluster labels.
- Added `scripts/analysis/multiscale_umap_overlay.py` for Julia-style
  multi-scale UMAP review. The helper joins `multiscale_gene_assignments.csv`
  to existing UMAP coordinates, colors stable regions first, and overlays
  pass-through or guard zones. The selected-family panel now writes the null
  role as `selected_null` and sample-level gene assignments with decomposition
  sample labels, so default CSV readers and UMAP joins do not lose the role or
  sample identifier.
- Added checkpoint/resume and per-row timeout support to
  `selected_family_traversal_panel.py`, then ran a one-replicate full-suite
  supported smoke for `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1`. The run
  completed `101` of `106` supported binary/direct-categorical rows; five
  expensive high-dimensional categorical or overlap rows timed out at the
  `60` second per-row budget and were recorded in the manifest. Completed
  direct-categorical null rows stayed closed, but binary overlap-template nulls
  had four false splits and several binary/categorical signal rows were weak,
  so both production-admissibility summaries remain fail-closed.
- Added `scripts/analysis/run_selected_family_matrix.py` and ran the full
  Julia GO binary matrix through
  `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1`, writing
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/julia_selected_family_20260614/` and
  [[julia-selected-family-run-20260614]]. The selected-family profile returned
  `401` clusters, `306` singletons, `8` blocked selected-family/root guard
  rows, reference ARI `0.064157`, and reference NMI `0.618847`. The UMAP
  overlay shows stable regions more clearly after annotating the dominant
  selected-root guard zone `zone_N1404` covering `665` genes instead of
  outlining nearly every point.
- Added opt-in phylogenetic tree construction for KL runs:
  `kl_neighbor_joining` builds a neighbor-joining tree from the KL tree
  distance vector, `kl_iqtree3` calls an external IQ-TREE 3 binary and parses
  the resulting Newick tree, and both are rooted with minimum ancestor
  deviation before conversion to `PosetTree`. Added
  [[phylogenetic-tree-builders-20260614]] to keep this root-orientation
  implementation separate from the still-open selected-root/selected-family
  null-law problem.
- Ran the combined Julia GO matrix through baseline KL, MAD-rooted neighbor
  joining, and IQ-TREE 3 fast/MAD, then copied compact artifacts to
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/julia_tree_estimators_20260614/` and added
  [[julia-tree-estimator-run-20260614]]. Baseline KL produced `670` clusters
  with reference NMI `0.633958`; neighbor joining produced `494` clusters with
  reference NMI `0.616780`; IQ-TREE fast/MAD produced `566` clusters with
  reference NMI `0.629320`. The result shows tree estimator changes alter
  fragmentation but do not solve selected traversal calibration.
- Regenerated the Julia tree-estimator UMAP plots with high-contrast cluster
  color maps under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/julia_tree_estimators_20260614/umap_plots/`.
  The clearer variants highlight only the largest non-singleton clusters with
  black outlines and encode cluster-size classes separately, because hundreds
  of tiny cluster IDs cannot be read reliably as one categorical colormap.
- Added `scripts/analysis/cluster_diagnostics_panel.py` and ran it over the
  Julia tree-estimator artifacts. The resulting
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/julia_tree_estimators_20260614/clustering_diagnostics/`
  bundle separates cluster-size fragmentation, reference recovery,
  reference-label fragmentation, method-cluster reference purity, UMAP
  compactness, and active-feature Jaccard coherence.
- Added full Julia UMAP exports under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/julia_tree_estimators_20260614/umap_plots/`:
  a static all-gene reference-endotype view, a static all-gene method
  cluster-size view, and an interactive HTML view with per-gene cluster and
  reference metadata on hover.
- Ran a post-hoc alpha sensitivity audit for the Julia linkage and
  neighbor-joining tree-estimator runs, saving node-level default gate
  annotations and retresholded alpha-grid summaries under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/julia_tree_estimators_20260614/alpha_audit/`.
  The audit shows edge decisions are nearly saturated, while sibling alpha
  controls a fragmentation versus UMAP-scatter tradeoff rather than producing
  clean UMAP-local clusters.
- Debugged the Julia UMAP/alpha analysis. The row-level interactive data has
  the expected `703 x 3` method rows with no duplicate gene-method entries, and
  stored assignment cluster sizes match recomputed sizes. Generated a
  standalone Plotly HTML because the first interactive export referenced the
  Plotly CDN, and added
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/julia_tree_estimators_20260614/analysis_debug_report.md`
  to document the CDN issue and the post-hoc nature of the alpha audit.
- Added [[overlap-structural-sibling-panel-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_structural_sibling_panel.py` and
  `tests/validation/103_test_overlap_structural_sibling_panel.py`. The focused
  null/signal run over four binary overlap cases wrote `68` analytical rows
  under `raw/assets/benchmark-results/overlap_structural_sibling_20260614/`.
  All `38` selected-null rows were `weak_homogeneity_gain`, while accepted
  null splits retained the expected edge/sibling barycentric support alignment;
  the overlap failure is selected contrast without structural homogeneity gain.
- Tightened the overlap structural sibling panel so structure-versus-homogeneity
  support agreement is explicit. The regenerated outputs add
  `max_edge_homogeneity_jaccard_topk` and
  `subspace_consensus_jaccard_topk`; the same four-case run still classifies
  all selected-null analytical rows as `weak_homogeneity_gain`, not as
  structural-homogeneity subspace mismatches.
- Extended the same panel with heterogeneity-focused subspace support,
  heterogeneity pairwise gains, and `structural_change_mode`. The regenerated
  four-case output has no rows with strong same-subspace heterogeneity
  (`heterogeneity_gain_max >= 0.02`); selected-null rows remain weak/mixed
  structural change, while five signal rows are homogeneous same-subspace.
- Added [[overlap-structural-threshold-sensitivity-20260614]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_structural_threshold_sensitivity.py`
  and `tests/validation/104_test_overlap_structural_threshold_sensitivity.py`.
  The post-run sweep over `2304` case-level rows shows homogeneity gain around
  `0.02` as the focused overlap separator: zero null false accepts, all five
  truth-aligned signal accepts retained, and zero truth-misaligned accepts.
  Sibling p-value thresholds from `0.001` to `0.05` do not change the best
  rows, so alpha tightening alone is not the main traversal fix here.
- Extended the overlap threshold analyzer with case-replicate stability fields
  and ran a three-replicate four-case overlap follow-up under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/overlap_structural_sibling_replicates_20260614/`.
  The replicate run weakens the one-seed threshold hypothesis: homogeneity
  threshold `0.02` still blocks null false accepts and truth-misaligned
  accepts, but retains only `12/17` truth-aligned accepts and `6/8`
  truth-aligned signal case-replicates. Threshold `0.01` retains `15/17`
  truth-aligned accepts but keeps two truth-misaligned accepts, while `0.005`
  leaves null false accepts. No tested threshold is stable enough for a method
  rule.
- Added [[overlap-structural-context-thresholds-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_structural_context_thresholds.py`
  and `tests/validation/105_test_overlap_structural_context_thresholds.py`.
  The context-binned run over the three-replicate overlap rows produced `864`
  sensitivity rows and `12` summary rows. Deep/internal contexts retained
  `7/7` truth-aligned signal accepts with zero null structural accepts at a
  permissive homogeneity threshold, while shallow and medium-parent contexts
  showed signal loss and large-parent contexts kept truth-misaligned signal.
  This points to context-conditioned traversal structure checks rather than a
  global cutoff.
- Added [[overlap-structural-continuous-rule-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_structural_continuous_rule.py`
  and `tests/validation/106_test_overlap_structural_continuous_rule.py`.
  The first continuous traversal-context grid evaluated `432` smooth threshold
  surfaces over depth, parent size, and barycentric balance; a finer follow-up
  evaluated `1200`. Neither produced a clean candidate. The best coarse rule
  blocked null and truth-misaligned accepts but retained only `7/8`
  truth-aligned signal case-replicates. Direct row inspection showed all null
  and truth-misaligned accepts in the weak-homogeneity region, while only
  `12/17` truth-aligned signal accepts were structurally same-subspace
  supported. The current method direction is therefore a continuous structural
  traversal rule with an explicit ambiguous multi-scale zone, not a forced
  global or additive accept cutoff.
- Added [[overlap-structural-decision-zones-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_structural_decision_zones.py`
  and `tests/validation/107_test_overlap_structural_decision_zones.py`.
  The three-way diagnostic zone run over the same three-replicate overlap rows
  writes stable, unstable weak-homogeneity, and nonaccepted rows. Accepted-row
  composition is cleanly separated: `stable_structural_accept` has `12`
  truth-aligned signal rows and zero null or truth-misaligned rows, while
  `unstable_weak_homogeneity_zone` has all `23` selected-null accepted rows,
  all `20` truth-misaligned signal accepted rows, and the remaining `5`
  truth-aligned accepted rows. This makes the next traversal method target an
  explicit unstable multi-scale zone plus selected-family null law, not alpha
  tuning.
- Added [[overlap-weak-zone-separability-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_weak_zone_separability.py` and
  `tests/validation/108_test_overlap_weak_zone_separability.py`. The panel
  scans scalar metrics inside `unstable_weak_homogeneity_zone`. Homogeneity
  gain nearly separates weak truth-aligned signal from selected null alone
  (`AUC = 0.991304`, zero-null retention `4/5`), but against selected null plus
  truth-misaligned signal the best zero-negative scalar threshold retains only
  `2/5` weak truth-aligned rows. The highest-AUC combined metric,
  context-homogeneity margin, retains `0/5` at zero leakage. This confirms
  that the weak-zone blocker is a selected-family mixture law, not a scalar
  threshold or alpha tuning issue.
- Added [[overlap-weak-family-thresholds-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_weak_family_thresholds.py` and
  `tests/validation/109_test_overlap_weak_family_thresholds.py`. The panel
  aggregates unstable weak-zone rows by `(case_id, data_role, replicate)`.
  Family-level selected p-values perfectly separate weak truth-aligned signal
  families from selected-null families in the focused run (`AUC = 1.0`,
  zero-null retention `5/5`), but fail against truth-misaligned signal
  families. Against selected-null plus truth-misaligned families, p-value
  metrics retain `0/5` positives at zero leakage, and the best combined
  family-level zero-negative rule retains only `2/5`. This confirms the open
  traversal object is a selected-family mixture law, not row or family alpha
  tightening.
- Added [[overlap-weak-truth-geometry-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_weak_truth_geometry.py` and
  `tests/validation/110_test_overlap_weak_truth_geometry.py`. The oracle-only
  panel classifies weak accepted signal rows by truth geometry. In the
  three-replicate overlap run, weak rows include `3` balanced truth recoveries,
  `2` partial truth recoveries, `8` one-sided pure fragments, `1` one-sided
  mixed remainder, `3` balanced wrong-granularity rows, and `8` diffuse truth
  mismatches. This explains why selected-family p-values are insufficient:
  pure-fragment splits can be statistically extreme while leaving a mixed
  sibling remainder, so the selected-family law needs a structural recovery
  target, not only an extremeness target.
- Added [[overlap-recovery-proxy-separability-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_recovery_proxy_separability.py`
  and `tests/validation/111_test_overlap_recovery_proxy_separability.py`.
  The panel evaluates non-oracle structural proxies against the oracle
  truth-geometry labels. Fragment-risk, size balance, edge-norm balance, and
  homogeneity symmetry distinguish truth recovery from one-sided fragment-like
  rows; `fragment_risk_proxy_score` reaches `AUC = 0.955556` and keeps `3/5`
  recovery rows at zero fragment leakage. The same proxies do not separate
  recovery from all non-recovery rows: the best full non-recovery metric keeps
  only `1/5` recovery rows at zero leakage. This supports a future fragment
  guard but not a complete selected-family law.
- Added [[overlap-fragment-risk-guard-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_fragment_risk_guard.py` and
  `tests/validation/112_test_overlap_fragment_risk_guard.py`. The guard scan
  evaluates non-oracle fragment-risk thresholds over all unstable weak-zone
  rows, including selected-null rows. The best focused candidate,
  `fragment_risk_proxy_score >= 1.252729`, retains `5/5` truth-recovery rows
  while blocking `8/9` fragment-like rows, `6/23` selected-null rows, and
  `1/11` diffuse/wrong rows. Size, barycentric, and edge-balance thresholds
  around `0.33`/`0.50` block `7/9` fragment-like rows with no recovery loss.
  This supports a diagnostic fragment-risk guard experiment, not production
  promotion.
- Updated [[overlap-structural-decision-zones-20260614]] after exposing the
  context-conditioned traversal rule as signed continuous margins in
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_structural_decision_zones.py`.
  The rule uses a smooth threshold over depth, parent size, and barycentric
  balance, then requires nonnegative homogeneity, subspace-consensus, and
  log-p margins for stable acceptance. Regenerated decision-zone outputs keep
  the same zone composition: `stable_structural_accept` has `12` truth-aligned
  signal rows and no null or truth-misaligned rows, while
  `unstable_weak_homogeneity_zone` contains all `23` selected-null accepted
  rows and all `20` truth-misaligned signal accepted rows. The median minimum
  continuous margin is `0.017777` in the stable zone and `-0.009088` in the
  weak zone.
- Added [[overlap-diagnostic-traversal-policy-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_diagnostic_traversal_policy.py`
  and `tests/validation/113_test_overlap_diagnostic_traversal_policy.py`.
  The composer applies the exact focused fragment-risk threshold
  `1.252728536810977` to the continuous decision-zone output without changing
  production behavior. In the focused overlap run it yields `12`
  `stable_region_accept` rows, `15` `weak_fragment_guard_blocked` rows, `33`
  `weak_unstable_multiscale_zone` rows, and `112` nonaccepted/leaf rows. The
  blocked weak rows include `8/9` fragment-like rows and no truth-recovery
  rows, but the remaining unstable zone still contains `17` selected-null rows,
  all `5` truth-recovery rows, `10` diffuse/wrong rows, and `11`
  truth-misaligned signal rows. This narrows the traversal fix to
  fragment-risk blocking plus an unresolved selected-family recovery law.
- Added [[overlap-residual-family-recovery-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_residual_family_recovery.py` and
  `tests/validation/114_test_overlap_residual_family_recovery.py`. The panel
  analyzes only rows left in `weak_unstable_multiscale_zone` after the
  continuous structural rule and fragment-risk guard. The residual family set
  contains `8` selected-null families, `5` truth-recovery families, and `3`
  non-recovery signal families. Residual family p-value extremeness separates
  recovery from selected null (`AUC = 1.0`, zero-null retention `5/5`) but not
  from non-recovery selected signal (`AUC = 0.666667`, zero-negative retention
  `0/5`), and still has zero-negative retention `0/5` against null plus
  non-recovery despite `AUC = 0.909091`. The best residual non-recovery
  structural metric, `residual_min_fragment_risk_proxy_score`, reaches
  `AUC = 0.866667` but retains only `3/5` recovery families at zero
  non-recovery leakage. This confirms the remaining traversal blocker is a
  selected-family structural recovery law, not p-value alpha tuning.
- Added [[overlap-residual-recovery-eligibility-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_residual_recovery_eligibility.py`
  and `tests/validation/115_test_overlap_residual_recovery_eligibility.py`.
  The eligibility layer separates residual selected-family null evidence from
  structural recovery evidence. In the focused overlap residual families,
  `residual_neg_log10_min_sibling_p_value > 8.454637` retains `5/5`
  truth-recovery families while selecting `0/8` selected-null families.
  `residual_min_fragment_risk_proxy_score > 0.747520` retains `3/5`
  truth-recovery families while selecting `0/3` non-recovery signal families,
  and the stricter all-negative threshold `> 1.076065` retains only `2/5`
  recovery families while selecting `0/11` negatives. This makes the current
  threshold hierarchy explicit: p-value evidence is a null filter; structural
  evidence is a recovery filter; neither alone is sufficient for production.
- Added [[overlap-threshold-hierarchy-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_threshold_hierarchy.py` and
  `tests/validation/116_test_overlap_threshold_hierarchy.py`. The hierarchy
  composes the focused overlap outputs into six ordered stages. Continuous
  structural stable acceptance retains `12/17` truth-aligned accepted rows and
  selects `0/43` selected-null or truth-misaligned accepted rows. The
  fragment-risk stage blocks `8/9` fragment-like weak rows and `0/5`
  truth-recovery rows. Residual selected-family null evidence retains `5/5`
  truth-recovery families with `0/8` selected-null families, while residual
  structural recovery evidence keeps only `3/5` or `2/5` truth-recovery
  families under non-recovery or all-negative control. The remaining blocker is
  the selected-family mixture where p-value evidence exists without sufficient
  structural recovery evidence.
- Added [[overlap-residual-threshold-transfer-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_residual_threshold_transfer.py`
  and `tests/validation/117_test_overlap_residual_threshold_transfer.py`. The
  transfer panel recomputes residual max-negative thresholds on leave-one-case
  and leave-one-replicate training splits. All residual threshold classes leak
  or lose recovery on held-out families. The residual p-value null-evidence
  threshold retains `5/5` held-out recovery families but selects `1/8`
  selected-null and `1/3` non-recovery families in both split kinds. The
  residual non-recovery structural threshold retains `3/5` recovery families
  but leaks `7/8` selected-null families in leave-one-case and `5/8` in
  leave-one-replicate, plus `1/3` non-recovery families. The strict
  all-negative structural threshold retains only `2/5` recovery families and
  still leaks selected-null families. This demotes focused cutpoints to
  explanatory diagnostics, not transferable calibration constants.
- Added [[overlap-threshold-stability-contract-20260614]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_threshold_stability_contract.py`
  and `tests/validation/118_test_overlap_threshold_stability_contract.py`.
  The contract classifies the six-stage threshold hierarchy after transfer
  testing: `1` stable-reporting stage, `1` diagnostic-only guard stage, `3`
  non-transferable focused cutpoints, and `4` stages requiring a selected-family
  law. The final status is `fail_closed_selected_family_law_required`, blocked
  by residual selected-family null evidence, residual structural evidence, the
  strict all-negative structural cutpoint, and the remaining p-value-only
  selected-family mixture. This records the current method state: report stable
  regions, keep fragment guard diagnostic, and do not promote residual
  thresholds without selected-family structural recovery theory.
- Added [[overlap-selected-family-law-requirements-20260614]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_selected_family_law_requirements.py`
  and `tests/validation/119_test_overlap_selected_family_law_requirements.py`.
  The diagnostic writes a conditioning envelope over residual family size,
  selected-family p-value evidence, homogeneity/context/subspace metrics,
  depth, parent size, barycentric balance, fragment risk, balanced recovery
  proxy, and size/edge balance. The four resulting requirements keep residual
  weak traversal fail-closed: selected-family null evidence is not
  transferable, the structural recovery target is missing, transfer validation
  is unsatisfied, and residual weak families must remain unstable multi-scale
  output until a selected-family structural recovery law is validated.
- Added [[overlap-conditional-bayesian-traversal-law-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_conditional_bayesian_traversal_law.py`
  and `tests/validation/120_test_overlap_conditional_bayesian_traversal_law.py`.
  The non-permutation diagnostic maps residual selected-family p-values to
  lower-bound Bayes-factor evidence, subtracts a selection-context penalty, and
  adds a structural neighborhood likelihood from homogeneity, continuous
  context, subspace, balance, recovery proxy, and fragment-risk terms. In the
  focused residual run, `0/8` selected-null families and `0/3` non-recovery
  families pass the strong-neighborhood coherent-candidate rule, while `1/5`
  truth-recovery families passes and `4/5` remain unstable. This confirms the
  next Bayesian law must model structural neighborhood likelihood, not only
  selected-family p-value evidence.
- Added [[overlap-bayesian-neighborhood-component-audit-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_bayesian_neighborhood_component_audit.py`
  and
  `tests/validation/121_test_overlap_bayesian_neighborhood_component_audit.py`.
  The audit shows selected-null residual families are blocked by context
  margin in `8/8` rows, non-recovery rows are blocked by context margin or
  subspace, and the blocked truth-recovery rows are limited by
  balanced-recovery, context-margin, or subspace terms. The next conditional
  Bayesian traversal law should preserve the context-margin selected-null
  blocker while replacing the coarse balanced-recovery and subspace proxies
  with an overlap-aware internal-node neighborhood likelihood.
- Added [[overlap-internal-node-bayesian-likelihood-probe-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_internal_node_bayesian_likelihood_probe.py`
  and
  `tests/validation/122_test_overlap_internal_node_bayesian_likelihood_probe.py`.
  The row-level overlap-aware likelihood probe selects `4/5` truth-recovery
  internal nodes and `0/28` selected-null, diffuse/wrong, or fragment-like
  rows in the focused residual panel. The result explains why family-level
  Bayesian aggregation was too coarse: selected families can contain one
  coherent internal node and one blocked neighboring node. The next traversal
  law should score internal nodes first and report mixed selected families as
  multi-scale structures, rather than forcing a whole-family promotion.
- Added [[overlap-internal-node-likelihood-sensitivity-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_internal_node_likelihood_sensitivity.py`
  and
  `tests/validation/123_test_overlap_internal_node_likelihood_sensitivity.py`.
  The `324`-point sensitivity grid reports `216` zero-negative rules and `24`
  zero-negative rules retaining at least `4/5` truth-recovery internal nodes.
  The default row-level likelihood rule is in that retaining band. Relaxing the
  context-margin floor to `-0.002` leaks negative rows for all `108/108` grid
  points, while floors `0.0` and `0.002` keep zero leakage. This records
  nonnegative context margin as the stable conditional gate; softer overlap
  tolerance should live in subspace, balance, and fragment-risk terms.
- Added [[overlap-internal-node-likelihood-transfer-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_internal_node_likelihood_transfer.py`
  and `tests/validation/124_test_overlap_internal_node_likelihood_transfer.py`.
  Leave-one-case transfer has `72` selected rule evaluations with zero leakage,
  while leave-one-replicate transfer has `24` leaking evaluations, all from
  `context_margin_floor = -0.002` rules. Restricting to nonnegative
  context-margin rules gives zero leakage for both split kinds, but replicate
  recovery retention remains incomplete. This keeps the row-level Bayesian
  likelihood diagnostic-only and sharpens the next target: improve
  overlap-internal subspace, balance, and fragment likelihood terms without
  relaxing nonnegative context margin.
- Added [[overlap-internal-node-transfer-gap-audit-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_internal_node_transfer_gap_audit.py`
  and
  `tests/validation/125_test_overlap_internal_node_transfer_gap_audit.py`.
  The audit shows the focused row-level panel recovers `4/5` truth-recovery
  internal nodes and selects `0/28` negative rows. The single missed truth row
  is `overlap_unbal_4c_small`, replicate `1`, node `N797`: it passes
  subspace, size-balance, edge-norm, and fragment-risk checks, but has
  negative local context margin. Since relaxed-context transfer rules produce
  `24` leakage evaluations and nonnegative-context rules produce `0`, the
  next repair must be a higher-order conditional/Bayesian law rather than a
  relaxed local context threshold.
- Added [[overlap-income-outcome-junction-law-20260615]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_income_outcome_junction_law.py`
  and `tests/validation/126_test_overlap_income_outcome_junction_law.py`.
  The diagnostic reframes the next law as directional incidence, not only
  node degree: incoming selected-parent context and outgoing child-sibling
  evidence are kept separate. In the focused residual panel, `32/33` rows have
  an observed incoming parent relation and `0/33` have nonnegative incoming
  context. Four truth-recovery rows are supported by outgoing local evidence,
  while the missed `overlap_unbal_4c_small` replicate `1` node `N797` is
  classified as `truth_recovery_income_outcome_context_transition_required`.
  This identifies the next mathematical object as a Bayesian transition law
  over \(I_u\), \(O_u\), and \(I_u \to O_u\) under the selected traversal
  event.
- Added [[overlap-branch-incidence-junction-panel-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_branch_incidence_junction_panel.py`
  and
  `tests/validation/127_test_overlap_branch_incidence_junction_panel.py`.
  This panel computes the actual incoming edge, incoming selected-family
  contrast, and outgoing child-sibling contrast from tree descendant means. In
  the focused overlap rerun it emits `148` branch-incidence rows and annotates
  `32` transfer-gap rows. All `5/5` annotated truth-recovery rows are
  coordinate branch-incidence mismatches, including the missed
  `overlap_unbal_4c_small` replicate `1` node `N797`; its
  incoming-family/outgoing top-k Jaccard is `0.0` and absolute cosine is
  `0.112750`. A follow-up metric-family extension added centered cosine,
  diagonal Fisher-weighted cosine, and Fisher-weighted top-coordinate overlap;
  the missed row's best metric-family score remains `0.112750`, classified as
  `metric_family_branch_mismatch`. The median truth-recovery metric-family
  score is `0.029662`, below the negative median `0.043478`. Therefore the
  next Bayesian traversal law should not enforce incoming/outgoing branch
  alignment as a hard recovery condition; it needs a separate emergent
  local-outcome mode.
- Added [[overlap-bayesian-incidence-mode-law-20260615]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_bayesian_incidence_mode_law.py`
  and `tests/validation/128_test_overlap_bayesian_incidence_mode_law.py`.
  The law has two diagnostic modes: continuation and emergent local outcome.
  Continuation has `0` candidates in the focused overlap panel because
  metric-family branch alignment is absent. Positive-context local outcome
  selects `4` rows, all truth-recovery with `0` negatives. Context-negative
  emergent mode is not identified: it contains `26` rows, with `1`
  truth-recovery and `25` negatives. The current admissible diagnostic
  boundary is therefore local outcome plus nonnegative context; the remaining
  task is to find an additional conditioning variable for the context-negative
  emergent row.
- Added [[overlap-context-negative-edge-conditioning-20260615]] after extending
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_branch_incidence_junction_panel.py`
  to export child-parent edge p-values and implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_context_negative_edge_conditioning.py`
  plus `tests/validation/129_test_overlap_context_negative_edge_conditioning.py`.
  The focused overlap rerun shows edge tests exist but do not solve the
  context-negative emergent ambiguity: among `26` rows there is `1`
  truth-recovery row and `25` negatives, the best outgoing edge-strength metric
  has AUC `0.916667` but zero-negative retention `0`, and edge rejection flags
  are saturated for truth and negatives. The next conditioning variable must
  encode selected neighborhood/topology or a higher-order ancestor/incoming/
  outgoing/family relation, not raw edge significance alone.
- Added [[overlap-context-negative-topology-conditioning-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_context_negative_topology_conditioning.py`
  and
  `tests/validation/130_test_overlap_context_negative_topology_conditioning.py`.
  The focused scan joins incidence-mode rows, true branch-incidence topology,
  internal-node transfer-gap structural evidence, and income/outcome context
  inside the same `26` context-negative emergent rows. It finds `7` numeric
  zero-negative separators and no categorical separator. The strongest
  interpretable candidate is the higher-order topology relation
  `balance_product = incoming_branch_balance * outgoing_balance`: the single
  truth row has value `0.232891`, the largest negative is `0.222500`, and the
  max-negative margin is `0.010391`. Pure outgoing balance also separates but
  narrowly (`0.492891` truth versus `0.491304` max negative). The result moves
  the method target toward a smooth incoming/outgoing selected-neighborhood
  topology likelihood, but remains diagnostic-only because it is a
  single-positive focused cutpoint requiring transfer validation.
- Added [[overlap-context-negative-topology-transfer-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_context_negative_topology_transfer.py`
  and
  `tests/validation/131_test_overlap_context_negative_topology_transfer.py`.
  The transfer audit learns zero-negative rules on held-out case and replicate
  folds. `balance_product` keeps zero held-out negative leakage in folds with a
  training rule, but no fold simultaneously has a training separator and
  held-out truth because the focused context-negative emergent slice has only
  one truth-recovery row. Its status is
  `transfer_unvalidated_no_truth_holdout_support`; nearby topology metrics
  leak one held-out negative under replicate splits. The candidate therefore
  remains a Bayesian/conditional likelihood direction, not a promotable
  threshold.
- Added [[overlap-context-negative-bayesian-topology-law-20260615]] after
  implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_context_negative_bayesian_topology_law.py`
  and
  `tests/validation/132_test_overlap_context_negative_bayesian_topology_law.py`.
  The diagnostic replaces the failed hard-threshold transfer direction with a
  continuous selected-neighborhood component law over incoming balance,
  outgoing balance, outgoing edge-norm balance, anti-fragment evidence,
  selected-family evidence, and soft context penalty. In the focused
  `context_negative_emergent` slice, the single truth row is top-ranked with
  posterior-style log odds `34.101999`; the strongest negative is `29.147130`,
  giving margin `4.954869`. Component summaries show outgoing balance and
  outgoing edge-norm balance carry the top rank, while raw edge significance is
  not used. The result remains diagnostic-only pending pooled support and
  weight uncertainty.
- Added [[overlap-context-negative-bayesian-topology-sensitivity-20260615]]
  after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_context_negative_bayesian_topology_sensitivity.py`
  and
  `tests/validation/133_test_overlap_context_negative_bayesian_topology_sensitivity.py`.
  The ablation audit evaluates `13` component profiles across context penalty
  weights `0`, `25`, `50`, `75`, and `100`. It finds `60/65` separating
  profile-weight combinations. Topology-only and outgoing-topology-only
  separate at all tested weights, while selected-family plus context separates
  in `0/5`. This supports the interpretation that the missing conditioning
  variable is structural selected-neighborhood topology, not selected-family
  evidence or context alone.
- Added [[topology-vector-benchmark-20260615]] after forwarding KL
  gate-profile parameters through `benchmarks/shared/runners/dispatch.py`,
  adding dispatch coverage in `tests/pipeline/51_test_dispatch_contract.py`,
  and running the regression-gate KL benchmark with default projected-Wald and
  `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1` variants. The refined
  profile eliminates default KL skips (`17/17` ok versus `11/17`), improves
  skip-as-zero mean ARI from `0.388484` to `0.445742`, and improves exact-K
  count from `3/17` to `5/17`, but ok-only mean ARI is lower
  (`0.445742` versus `0.600384`) and several easy non-overlap rows under-split.
  The benchmark supports the topology vector as a diagnostic conditioning
  object, not as a broad production traversal default.
- Added [[overlap-conditional-topology-law-panel-20260615]] after implementing
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap_conditional_topology_law_panel.py`,
  `tests/validation/134_test_overlap_conditional_topology_law_panel.py`, the
  diagnostic profile `fixed_coordinate_conditional_topology_diagnostic_v1`,
  and directed-incidence fields in selected-family multi-scale node decisions.
  The panel is non-cross-fit and non-permutation. On the focused `26`-row
  context-negative overlap slice, the single truth row remains rank `1`, with
  conditional log-odds `31.869341` versus strongest negative `27.174856`, but
  the status remains `support_insufficient_fail_closed` because the internal
  incidence support stratum has only one truth-recovery row. The result
  clarifies that the next mathematical object is a support-aware selected
  neighborhood conditional law, not raw edge strength, global homogeneity, or
  a tuned topology threshold. The benchmark-facing
  `kl_conditional_topology_diagnostic` method id also runs the 17-case
  regression gate with `17/17` ok rows, mean ARI `0.460293`, median ARI
  `0.480000`, and exact-K count `4/17`. A Julia binary matrix run writes a
  UMAP overlay and returns `410` final clusters from `703` samples, confirming
  that the profile is runnable but still fragmentation-heavy.
- Added [[cosine-band-coherence-comparator-20260615]] after porting the useful
  c2ef fixed cosine-band and coherence checks into
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/spectral/cosine_band_coherence_comparator.py` and
  `tests/validation/135_test_cosine_band_coherence_comparator.py`. The
  comparator keeps the historical fixed band labels, runs current
  gate/decomposition code on each band tree, reports feature-enrichment and
  within-cluster TF-IDF cosine coherence, and marks rows
  `diagnostic_only_not_production_calibration`.
- Ran the cosine-band comparator on the compact selected-root/pass-through null
  fixture and the Julia binary matrix. The null fixture returns one cluster in
  every binary and TF-IDF fixed band. The Julia run was sharded across eight
  AWS on-demand `c7i.xlarge` instances with all shard exit codes zero; merged
  evidence lives under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/cosine_band_coherence_comparator_20260615/julia_binary_sharded/merged/`.
  Julia remains fragmentation-heavy: `variation_36_80` has the strongest
  coherence fraction (`102/292 = 0.349315`), while `variation_06_15` and
  `variation_16_35` have singleton fractions above `0.84`.
- Added [[old-vs-current-method-stack-comparison-20260615]] after correcting
  the old/current comparison scope from classical clustering to the actual
  method stack: bandwidths, calibration strategies, heuristic guards, and
  traversal laws. The old c2ef stack's topology-aware sibling-null bandwidths
  (`tau_b`, `tau_t`, `tau_s`, `h_k`) encode structural neighborhood evidence
  more directly than the current strict support model, but a fresh full-Julia
  rerun stopped inside the adaptive bandwidth tree-distance loop after more
  than five minutes. Existing Julia outputs show the prior full KL stack at
  `670` clusters and the current conditional-topology diagnostic at `410`
  clusters, with ARI `0.062803` and NMI `0.923045`.
- Updated [[overlap-conditional-topology-law-panel-20260615]] so the old
  neighborhood/log-scale idea is represented as the explicit
  `neighborhood_scale_log_component` with `neighborhood_scale_support_*`
  counts. Missing scale is neutral when absent from the input table, but sparse
  or row-missing scale evidence is fail-closed and reflected in the production
  summary.
- Extended [[overlap-conditional-topology-law-panel-20260615]] with the old
  topology-aware sibling-null bandwidth geometry as a cached,
  support-gated `topology_neighborhood_log_component`. The implementation
  materializes all-pairs tree distances from `node_id`/`parent_id`, reports
  `tau_b`, `tau_t`, `tau_s`, and `h_k`, excludes selected-nonnull rows from
  support, and requires explicit topology signal roles before activation. The
  old/current smoke run on the `26`-row overlap slice has cached tree distances
  but no explicit topology signal roles, so the component remains neutral for
  all rows rather than leaking truth labels into calibration.
- Regenerated the context-negative topology-conditioning rows with explicit
  `parent_id`, `topology_support_role`, and `topology_signal_role`, then reran
  the conditional topology-law smoke. The source now has `17` strict-null
  support rows, `8` selected-nonnull exclusions, and one explicit signal row.
  The topology-neighborhood component activates on `25/26` rows and leaves one
  sparse group fail-closed. It is not a standalone separator: the focused truth
  component is `-0.606531`, the negative median is `-0.471195`, and `13`
  negatives exceed the truth component. The full Bayesian topology law still
  ranks the truth row first with log-odds margin `4.694486`.
- Added [[specific-small-method-benchmark-20260615]] after rerunning the
  focused small benchmark into
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/specific_small_method_benchmark_20260615/`.
  Three conditional-law variants show that topology-neighborhood bandwidth off
  and on both rank the truth row first with the same `4.694486` log-odds
  margin. The bandwidth component is active but non-separating; outgoing
  balance and outgoing edge-norm balance are the zero-negative topology
  separators. The method fix should therefore use bandwidth as support/context
  regularization, not as the traversal decision rule.
- Extended [[specific-small-method-benchmark-20260615]] with
  `focused_overlap_balance_product_benchmark.py` and a small selected-family
  traversal run over `overlap_mod_4c_small`, `overlap_unbal_4c_small`, and
  `overlap_extreme_4c`. In the multi-positive row fixture, `balance_product`
  separates `3` truth rows from `4` hard negatives with margin `0.015620`,
  while outgoing balance alone does not separate. In the clustering run, the
  conditional-topology diagnostic profile still false-splits selected-null rows
  and fragments one unbalanced signal replicate into `12` clusters, so the
  balance-product posterior should be an internal ambiguous-node recovery rule,
  not a global replacement for refined selected-family/root guards.
- Implemented the guarded internal recovery diagnostic in
  `overlap_conditional_topology_law_panel.py`:
  `recover_internal_split = root/null guards pass AND support sufficient AND
  balance_product/outgoing_edge evidence high`. Focused validation recovers
  all `3` synthetic overlap positives and blocks all `4` hard negatives. The
  regenerated real context-negative overlap law recovers `0` rows because the
  only truth row remains `support_insufficient_fail_closed`; this keeps the
  method fail-closed and identifies focused overlap-positive support as the
  next mathematical blocker.
- Added [[traversal-neighborhood-method-comparison]] after rechecking the old
  and current traversal implementations. The comparison records that both
  stacks use the same binary plus edge plus sibling traversal skeleton with
  pass-through. The old neighborhood terms changed sibling calibration through
  tree-neighborhood bandwidths, while the current strict path uses
  strict-null/stopped support and a narrower log-projection/log-parent-size
  kernel. The next distribution diagnostic should therefore measure selected
  neighborhoods at split, boundary, and pass-through states rather than treat
  neighborhood as a direct traversal cutoff.
- Added [[selected-neighborhood-distribution-panel-20260615]] and the
  executable `selected_neighborhood_distribution_panel.py`. The compact
  overlap run joins selected-family node decisions with context-negative
  topology rows and conditional-law rows, then summarizes split, boundary, and
  pass-through states. The first run has `43` split rows, `22308` boundary
  rows, `25` pass-through rows, only `38/22376` old-and-current neighborhood
  evidence rows, and `recover_internal_split_count = 0`. This turns the next
  blocker into a measurable distribution-coverage problem.
- Extended the selected-neighborhood distribution panel with
  `selected_neighborhood_coverage_summary.csv`, grouped by method, data role,
  traversal state, and stop reason. The rerun shows that old/current
  neighborhood evidence is concentrated around accepted split rows and a few
  selected-null stopped rows, while signal pass-through rows have zero
  old/current coverage. The previous neighborhood-calibrated stack therefore
  did not fully decide traversal stopping; it supplied sparse internal-node
  context around the same binary plus edge plus sibling traversal skeleton.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_case_coverage_summary.csv` to the same panel
  and reran the compact overlap slice. Case-level coverage is nearly absent in
  the signal rows where traversal behavior matters most:
  `overlap_extreme_4c` has `0/2398` old-and-current signal coverage,
  `overlap_mod_4c_small` has `1/1598`, and `overlap_unbal_4c_small` has
  `4/1598`. This confirms that restoring old bandwidth evidence alone cannot
  fix sibling-closed/pass-through traversal; it must become one component of a
  directed selected-neighborhood law.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_method_contrast_summary.csv`, pairing traversal
  profiles on identical `case_id,data_role,replicate,node_id` keys. The compact
  overlap rerun shows `11151/11188` paired traversal decisions agree, but the
  agreement is dominated by leaves and non-candidate boundaries. The
  conditional-topology profile has `24` splits and `18` pass-throughs; the
  refined global pass-through profile has `19` splits and `7` pass-throughs
  plus more explicit guard blocks. The real method difference is therefore
  localized to selected candidate neighborhoods, not the full tree node pool.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_candidate_method_contrast_summary.csv`, which
  conditions the paired comparison on nodes where either method split, passed
  through, explicit-guard-blocked, or had old-and-current neighborhood evidence.
  The denominator drops from `11188` paired tree nodes to `50` candidate nodes,
  and traversal agreement drops from `0.996693` to `32/50`. This is the clean
  current understanding of the two methods: they share the same broad
  traversal skeleton, but behave differently on the selected candidate stratum
  that needs the directed selected-neighborhood law.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_candidate_method_contrast_rows.csv` to expose
  those `50` candidate nodes directly. The detail rows show `18` divergent
  candidates, including `10` conditional-profile pass-throughs that the refined
  profile turns into `not_visited` or `boundary`. Selected-null divergences
  often look like successful conservative guard suppression, while
  `overlap_unbal_4c_small` signal divergences look like possible
  over-suppression. Many signal pass-through divergences are still
  `traversal_only`, so the missing object remains a selected-neighborhood
  pass-through law rather than a simple old-bandwidth restoration.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_candidate_ambiguity_summary.csv`, grouping the
  node-level candidate rows into interpretation buckets. The compact run has
  `8` conservative selected-null suppressions and `8` possible signal
  over-suppressions. The possible signal over-suppression bucket has `0/8`
  old-and-current neighborhood coverage and `8/8` traversal-only pairs, which
  shows that the next law needs additional pass-through-local evidence or an
  explicit conditional law for traversal-only candidate neighborhoods.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_candidate_local_feature_summary.csv`, which
  summarizes depth, descendant size, edge/sibling flags, sibling p-values, and
  topology evidence by ambiguity bucket. The possible
  `overlap_unbal_4c_small` signal over-suppression bucket has `8/8` edge-open
  rows, `7/8` pass-through candidates, median sibling p-value `0.003135`,
  median depth `5.5`, median descendant leaves `86.5`, and no finite
  `balance_product` coverage. Selected-null conservative suppressions also
  have low median sibling p-values, so local edge/sibling significance cannot
  distinguish false selected-null candidates from possible true unbalanced
  signal pass-throughs.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_candidate_law_target_summary.csv`, translating
  ambiguity buckets into explicit diagnostic obligations. The compact run has
  `8` rows requiring
  `derive_traversal_only_pass_through_retention_law`, one additional
  traversal-only divergence requiring inspection, and all of those remain
  `fail_closed_until_law_validated`. The `8` selected-null suppressions target
  `validate_false_positive_suppression_law` while retaining the refined
  fail-closed guard.
- Extended the selected-neighborhood candidate contrast with descendant
  outcome counts below each candidate node. The rerun shows that the
  `overlap_unbal_4c_small` possible signal over-suppression bucket has `7`
  conditional-profile descendant accepted splits versus `0` on the refined
  side, but selected-null conservative suppressions also have downstream
  conditional splits (`3` in `overlap_extreme_4c` and `2` in
  `overlap_mod_4c_small`). This confirms that the previous traversal stop rule
  was edge/neighborhood/pass-through sensitive, but descendant activity alone
  cannot become a retention rule. The law target for these signal rows is now
  recorded as `missing_topology_evidence_for_downstream_splits`.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_stop_rule_comparison_summary.csv` to name and
  summarize the traversal stop/pass-through mechanism at candidate nodes. The
  shared pattern `left_pass_through_downstream_split_right_stops` appears in
  both selected-null conservative suppressions and
  `overlap_unbal_4c_small` possible signal over-suppressions. This pins the
  method distinction to selected pass-through-neighborhood retention, not to a
  different base traversal equation.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_retention_evidence_summary.csv`, conditioning
  evidence on the stop-rule pattern itself. For
  `left_pass_through_downstream_split_right_stops`, selected-null rows have
  `5` conditional pass-throughs and `5` downstream conditional accepted splits
  with `1` finite `balance_product`, while signal rows have `7` conditional
  pass-throughs and `7` downstream conditional accepted splits but `7/7`
  traversal-only pairs and `0` finite `balance_product`. This moves the method
  comparison from "which method walks?" to "where is structural topology
  evidence absent for retained pass-through walks?"
- Added `selected_neighborhood_retention_gap_summary.csv`, translating the
  pattern-conditioned evidence into explicit law requirements. The selected-null
  side requires a null-side selected-pass-through false-positive law and keeps
  `retain_fail_closed_refined_guard`; the signal side requires a signal-side
  topology likelihood for retained pass-through walks and stays
  `fail_closed_until_topology_law_validated`.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_method_contract_summary.csv`, which records the
  corrected method comparison as a contract: the base binary/edge/sibling
  pass-through traversal skeleton is shared; `selected_null_pass_through_control`
  is a non-shared component where the refined guard remains required; and
  `signal_pass_through_retention` is a non-shared component where conditional
  recovery remains unvalidated until the topology likelihood is derived.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_profile_config_contract_summary.csv`, derived
  from the actual `SIBLING_GATE_PROFILES`. It verifies that the two compared
  profiles share `fixed_coordinate_bh`, alpha penalty `50`, and the same
  selected-root stability guard settings. The concrete profile difference is
  the refined selected-family global sibling-min pass-through guard:
  `99` draws, alpha `0.01`, and scope
  `global_sibling_min_passthrough_descendant_refined` versus no selected-family
  permutation guard in the conditional topology diagnostic profile.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_method_readiness_summary.csv`, translating the
  method and profile contracts into per-method readiness verdicts. Both
  profiles are diagnostic-ready only for the shared traversal skeleton; the
  refined profile is ready as a fail-closed selected-null pass-through guard
  candidate; and the conditional topology profile is not ready for production
  signal pass-through retention until the signal-side topology likelihood is
  derived.
- Added `retained_pass_through_topology_likelihood_panel.py` and validation
  tests. The compact run on selected-neighborhood candidate rows finds `7`
  signal retained-pass-through rows, `5` selected-null controls, `5` matched
  signal rows, `2` unmatched signal rows, and `0` matched controls with finite
  topology features. The summary status is
  `signal_topology_likelihood_not_identifiable`, with production action
  `fail_closed_until_likelihood_identifiable`.
- Extended the retained pass-through topology likelihood panel with directed
  traversal-network context from `selected_neighborhood_distribution_rows.csv`.
  The compact rerun has finite pass-through-context and downstream
  accepted-split distances for `7/7` signal rows and `5/5` selected-null
  controls, with all `5` matched rows traversal-neighborhood matched. Exact
  tree-network distance remains unavailable because those matches are
  cross-case selected-null controls. The topology likelihood remains
  unidentifiable and production remains fail-closed.
- Added [[overlap-selected-pass-through-fixture-miner-20260615]] and the
  executable `overlap_selected_pass_through_fixture_miner.py`. The compact run
  mines `12` selected pass-through event rows:
  `7` signal candidates from `overlap_unbal_4c_small` replicate `0` and `5`
  selected-null controls from `overlap_extreme_4c` and
  `overlap_mod_4c_small`. Traversal context is finite for all rows. Direct
  topology support remains absent on the signal side (`0` rows) and sparse on
  the selected-null side (`1` row), so the direct support status is
  `signal_topology_support_missing`.
- Extended the selected pass-through fixture miner with a structural topology
  fallback computed from selected-tree descendant masses:
  incoming node-versus-sibling balance, outgoing child balance, and their
  product. The compact rerun has structural topology for `7/7` signal rows and
  `5/5` selected-null controls; completed topology support is observed for
  `7/7` signal rows and `3/5` selected-null controls. The completed support
  status is
  `selected_pass_through_completed_topology_support_observed_diagnostic_only`,
  and completed balance product separates the finite compact selected-event rows
  in the low direction at threshold `0.02594`, retaining `7/7` signal candidates
  with `0` finite selected-null controls. The next required step is
  `expand_selected_pass_through_fixture_support_and_truth_labels`.
- Ran an expanded selected pass-through overlap sweep over seven binary overlap
  cases, five replicates, null/signal data roles, and the conditional-topology
  and refined global pass-through profiles. The selected-neighborhood
  distribution plus fixture miner now mines `50` selected-event rows:
  `19` signal candidates and `31` selected-null controls. Completed topology
  support is observed for `17/19` signal candidates and `20/31` selected-null
  controls, but the low-direction completed-balance-product separator overlaps
  `10` finite selected-null controls. The structural fallback is therefore a
  useful conditioning variable, not a standalone selected pass-through
  retention law.
- Extended the selected pass-through fixture miner with synthetic benchmark
  truth context from traversal `data_seed` values and
  `multiscale_gene_assignments.csv` path membership. The truth-labeled
  expanded run keeps production fail-closed and classifies the `19` signal
  selected-event rows as `0` full branch recoveries, `0` partial branch
  recoveries, `1` barycentric mixture candidate, `14` false fragments, and
  `4` unresolved signal candidates. The next method object is therefore a
  selected-neighborhood law that separates branch recovery from barycentric
  mixture and false fragments.
- Added [[selected-pass-through-branch-recovery-conditioning-20260615]] and the
  executable `selected_pass_through_branch_recovery_conditioning.py`. The
  focused fixture has `3` full branch recoveries, `1` partial branch recovery,
  `1` barycentric mixture, `2` false fragments, and `2` selected-null controls.
  Oracle branch indicators separate all branch rows, but observable topology
  metrics still leak a selected-null control. The real expanded overlap rows
  remain `full_branch_recovery_support_missing`, so production stays
  `fail_closed_until_branch_law_validated`.
- Rechecked the previous c2ef bandwidth method and updated
  [[traversal-neighborhood-method-comparison]] and
  [[old-vs-current-method-stack-comparison-20260615]] with the explicit old
  sibling-null-prior bandwidth equations. The checked conclusion is that the
  old bandwidth system is useful as topology/context support, but the current
  cached replay is non-separating on the focused overlap slice, so the next
  method object remains a directed selected-neighborhood branch-recovery law,
  not a restoration of the old bandwidth threshold.
- Extended `selected_pass_through_branch_recovery_conditioning.py` with an
  optional non-oracle feature-geometry layer computed from
  `multiscale_gene_assignments.csv` path membership and regenerated benchmark
  feature matrices. The focused feature-geometry fixture now has observable
  `feature_branch_geometry_score` and homogeneity/subspace-consensus metrics
  separating branch recovery from barycentric, fragment, and selected-null
  controls, while balance-product metrics still leak. The real expanded overlap
  rerun observes feature geometry for all `50` selected pass-through rows but
  still has `0` full or partial branch-recovery positives, so the next required
  step is to generate or mine real selected pass-through branch-positive cases
  with matched selected-null controls. Production remains
  `fail_closed_until_branch_law_validated`.
- Added a generated selected-pass-through branch-positive support fixture to
  the same panel. It uses existing binary benchmark feature matrices and
  synthetic selected path membership to create `3` full branch recoveries,
  `1` partial branch recovery, `1` barycentric mixture, `1` false fragment, and
  `3` selected-null controls. The generated support run writes the source node
  rows and gene assignments, and `feature_homogeneity_gain_min` plus
  `feature_branch_geometry_score` separate branch rows from controls while
  balance product still leaks. This validates the non-oracle feature geometry
  on generated support, but production remains fail-closed until the law is
  validated on real traversal-selected branch positives.
- Ran a targeted real traversal-selected branch-positive search over
  `binary_perfect_4c`, `binary_low_noise_4c`, `binary_moderate_4c`, and
  `overlap_part_4c_small` with the conditional-topology and refined global
  pass-through profiles. The fixture miner finds `12` selected-event rows:
  `7` signal rows and `5` selected-null controls. Branch conditioning
  classifies all `7` signal rows as false fragments, with `0` full or partial
  branch recoveries. Completed balance product separates selected-event signal
  rows from selected-null controls in this run, but it separates false
  fragments, not recoveries. This reinforces the rechecked c2ef bandwidth
  conclusion: tree-neighborhood/balance evidence is context, while production
  needs a feature-subspace selected-neighborhood branch law with real
  traversal-selected positives.
- Ran the same selected pass-through branch-positive search across the full
  binary benchmark suite: all `42` binary cases, `3` replicates, null/signal
  roles, and the conditional-topology plus refined global pass-through
  profiles. The traversal, distribution, fixture-miner, and branch-conditioning
  outputs live under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/specific_small_method_benchmark_20260615/selected_pass_through_branch_positive_binary_suite_*`.
  The miner finds `92` selected-event rows (`61` signal-side candidates and
  `31` selected-null controls), but branch conditioning finds `0` full or
  partial branch recoveries: `56` signal rows are false fragments and `5` are
  unresolved. Feature geometry is observed on all `92` rows, so the blocker is
  not missing measurement; it is missing real selected-positive support. The
  next fixture must be a targeted real traversal-selected branch-recovery
  stress case or a revised selected-event definition.
- Enabled the existing `planted_hierarchy_deep_signal` method-proof generator
  for selected-family diagnostics by treating it as a binary-template source
  for null regeneration, then added
  `traversal_deep_branch_recovery_stress` with very weak root contrast and
  very strong sparse descendant blocks. The existing planted case produces
  selected pass-through rows but only unresolved downstream truth. The stronger
  stress case produces many selected pass-through rows, but the selected-event
  miner classifies `28/28` signal rows as false fragments. A separate
  candidate own-split truth audit on the same run finds `13` full branch
  recoveries and `3` partial branch recoveries, all among accepted split
  candidates; pass-through candidates have maximum own-split ARI `0.140288`.
  The method implication is that retained pass-through should not be promoted
  as branch recovery. The next law should preserve accepted branch splits while
  suppressing homogeneous pass-through fragments.
- Added [[selected-candidate-truth-law-panel-20260615]] and
  `selected_candidate_truth_law_panel.py` to make the inline own-split audit
  reusable. The stress rerun writes
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/specific_small_method_benchmark_20260615/selected_candidate_truth_law_stress/`
  and reports `116` selected candidate rows: `114` signal rows, `2`
  selected-null controls, `13` full branch recoveries, `3` partial branch
  recoveries, `84` false fragments, and `14` unresolved signal rows. All full
  branch recoveries are split/split accepted candidates; pass-through rows
  remain capped at own-split ARI `0.140288`. Production remains
  `diagnostic_only_no_promotion`.
- Extended the selected-candidate truth-law panel with immediate-split
  non-oracle feature geometry and
  `selected_candidate_feature_metric_summary.csv`. The stress rerun observes
  feature geometry for all `116` candidates. `feature_homogeneity_gain_min`
  and `feature_branch_geometry_score` separate the `13` full branch recoveries
  from `84` false fragments plus `2` selected-null controls with zero negative
  leakage. This supports a candidate-level structural rule on the stress
  fixture, but remains diagnostic-only until transfer is validated.
- Added a generated-support mode to the selected-candidate truth-law panel.
  It converts generated pass-through support rows into immediate split
  candidates at `truth_downstream_split_node_id`, writes
  `generated_support_candidate_rows.csv`, and reruns the candidate law under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/specific_small_method_benchmark_20260615/selected_candidate_truth_law_generated_support/`.
  The run has `3` full branch recoveries, `2` false fragments, `3`
  selected-null controls, and `1` unresolved overlap partial row.
  `feature_homogeneity_gain_min`, `feature_child_contrast_norm`, and
  `feature_branch_geometry_score` separate full branch recoveries from the
  false-fragment plus selected-null negatives with zero leakage. This validates
  the immediate-split feature geometry on generated benchmark matrices, but not
  yet on real traversal-selected overlap positives.
- Extended the selected-candidate truth-law panel with
  `selected_candidate_feature_metric_state_summary.csv`, which stratifies
  feature metrics by traversal state scope. Reran the panel on stress,
  generated support, expanded overlap, targeted real-search, and the full
  binary-suite candidate rows. Expanded overlap has `302` candidates with
  `45` full branch recoveries, `19` partial branch recoveries, `16` false
  fragments, `133` selected-null controls, and `89` unresolved rows; it also
  finds `2` real pass-through branch recoveries. The full binary-suite audit
  has `1000` candidates with `268` full branch recoveries, `50` partial branch
  recoveries, `364` false fragments, `98` selected-null controls, and `220`
  unresolved rows, with `1` pass-through branch recovery. Feature homogeneity
  and branch geometry retain high AUC on real candidates, but no longer have
  zero-negative separation. Pass-through branch positives are weak-feature
  rows, so the next law must be traversal-state/pass-through conditioned rather
  than a single homogeneity cutoff.
- Extended the selected-candidate truth-law panel again with
  `selected_candidate_context_metric_state_summary.csv`, summarizing local
  traversal context by candidate state. Reran the expanded overlap,
  targeted real-search, and full binary-suite outputs. Expanded overlap
  `pass_through_any` has two branch recoveries with minimum descendant sibling
  p-values `0.094013` and `0.001126`, but no context metric achieves
  zero-negative separation from false fragments or selected-null controls. The
  binary suite has a single pass-through branch row whose minimum sibling
  p-value separates only in that slice, so it is not a transferable rule. This
  closes the local-context shortcut and keeps the open method object as a
  higher-order selected-neighborhood/family law.
- Extended the selected-candidate truth-law panel with
  `selected_candidate_family_likelihood_rows.csv` and
  `selected_candidate_family_likelihood_summary.csv`. The diagnostic groups
  selected candidates by run, ambiguity bucket, and stop-rule pattern, then
  marks matched selected-null collisions only for selected stop-rule families.
  Reran stress, generated support, expanded overlap, targeted real-search, and
  full binary-suite outputs. Generated support has `3` clean branch families
  and no colliding branch families. Real pass-through positives are collision
  cases: expanded overlap has `2` pass-through branch-positive families, both
  colliding with matched selected-null controls and one with `5` false
  fragments; targeted real search repeats those `2`; the binary suite has `1`
  pass-through branch-positive family and it also collides with matched
  selected-null control. Accepted split/split branch families remain cleaner
  (`22`, `14`, and `65` clean families in expanded overlap, targeted
  real-search, and binary suite respectively), so accepted split preservation
  and pass-through retention must be separate law components.
- Added `selected_candidate_collision_law_components.csv` to the same panel
  and reran stress, generated support, expanded overlap, targeted real-search,
  and binary-suite outputs. The component layer makes the selected-family law
  contract explicit. Generated support has a clean accepted-split preservation
  component with `3` clean branch families. Expanded overlap accepted-split
  preservation has `22` clean branch families but `1` colliding branch family,
  targeted real-search has `14` clean and `2` colliding, and the binary suite
  has `65` clean and `40` colliding, so accepted-split preservation remains
  diagnostic-only until a fragment filter exists. Pass-through retention is
  stricter: expanded overlap has `2/2`, targeted real-search has `2/2`, and
  the binary suite has `1/1` pass-through branch families colliding, giving
  `pass_through_branch_families_all_collide` and
  `fail_closed_until_collision_law_validated`. Selected-null suppression and
  guard-stop fragment suppression remain retained fail-closed guard
  components.
- Added `selected_candidate_accepted_split_filter_rows.csv` and
  `selected_candidate_accepted_split_filter_summary.csv` to test whether
  accepted split preservation has a simple non-oracle fragment filter. The
  generated-support run separates clean branch families from fragment families
  on homogeneity gain, branch geometry, and child contrast. Real transfer
  fails: expanded overlap has `22` clean accepted families versus `1`
  fragment-mixed branch family with no zero-negative metric separation;
  targeted real-search has `14` clean versus `2` fragment-mixed families with
  no separation; the binary suite has `65` clean versus `40` fragment-mixed
  families, also with no separating feature or context metric. Accepted split
  preservation therefore remains diagnostic-only and needs a family-level
  fragment law.
- Added `selected_candidate_accepted_split_pair_filter_summary.csv` to test
  axis-aligned two-metric accepted split filters. Generated support has full
  zero-negative pairwise filters. Real transfer only supports partial clean
  subsets: expanded overlap retains at most `20/22` clean accepted families at
  zero negatives, targeted real-search at most `10/14`, and the binary suite at
  most `44/65`. The best binary-suite pair still has production action
  `fail_closed_until_fragment_filter_validated`, so accepted split
  preservation remains an unresolved family-level fragment-law problem.
- Added `selected_candidate_accepted_split_frontier_summary.csv` to test
  monotone multi-metric dominance frontiers for accepted split preservation.
  Simple frontiers fail on real transfer: in the binary suite,
  `feature_strength_high` leaves only `9/65` clean families undominated and
  `feature_strength_with_fragment_penalty` leaves `16/65`; the
  `binary_transfer_best_pair_context` frontier leaves `57/65`. The richer
  `full_family_context_frontier` removes clean-family negative dominance in
  the real transfer runs, but it is diagnostic-only because it does not define
  a zero-negative calibrated selection region. The next object is a
  selected-family frontier law.
- Added `selected_candidate_frontier_law_rows.csv` and
  `selected_candidate_frontier_law_summary.csv` to make the selected-family
  frontier law diagnostic explicit without permutations or sample splitting.
  The law computes continuous margins
  \(m(x)=\min_{y\in\mathcal N}\max_j(x_j-y_j)\) against fragment controls and
  a \(\operatorname{Beta}(1,1)\) diagnostic posterior over clean-family
  non-domination. Regenerated the stress, generated-support, expanded-overlap,
  real-search, and binary-suite selected-candidate runs. The full binary suite
  gives `full_family_context_frontier`
  `65/65` clean non-dominated families against `40` finite fragment controls,
  posterior mean `0.985075`, lower `90%` approximation `0.960888`, and
  `selected_family_frontier_law_margin_thin_diagnostic`; the other
  binary-suite frontiers remain leaky, and the smaller transfer runs remain
  fail-closed for thin fragment-control support.
- Added `selected_candidate_frontier_ablation_summary.csv` to test whether the
  candidate frontier law is robust to removing one coordinate. On the full
  binary suite, `full_family_context_frontier` with all coordinates has
  `65/65` non-dominated clean families but minimum clean margin
  `1.245512e-11`, so it is `frontier_ablation_zero_leakage_but_margin_thin`.
  Removing `median_min_sibling_p_value` makes `11/65` clean families
  dominated, removing `max_feature_child_contrast_norm` makes `10/65`
  dominated, and removing `median_feature_branch_geometry_score` makes `1/65`
  dominated. The candidate is therefore a useful diagnostic frontier, but not
  yet a robust production law.
- Added `selected_candidate_frontier_witness_rows.csv` to record the nearest
  fragment-family witness and active coordinate for each clean accepted-split
  family. On the binary-suite `full_family_context_frontier`, `10/65` clean
  families are `frontier_margin_thin`, and all ten are saved only by
  `median_min_sibling_p_value`. Across all clean families, the active
  coordinate counts are `43` child-contrast, `11` sibling p-value, `8`
  homogeneity gain, and `3` branch geometry. This identifies the next
  mathematical issue: sibling p-value cannot be allowed to rescue margin-thin
  clean families without a structural explanation.
- Added `selected_candidate_sibling_rescue_audit_rows.csv` and
  `selected_candidate_sibling_rescue_audit_summary.csv` to test that issue
  directly. On the binary-suite `full_family_context_frontier`, all `11`
  sibling-p active rescues have no positive structural gap against their
  nearest fragment witness, including all `10` margin-thin rows. The summary
  status is `sibling_only_thin_rescue_requires_law` with production action
  `fail_closed_until_sibling_rescue_law_validated`. Expanded overlap has
  `4/22` full-context sibling-only thin rescues. This keeps the frontier law
  fail-closed until a structural sibling-rescue law is derived.
- Added `selected_candidate_sibling_rescue_guard_summary.csv` to quantify the
  conservative guard that blocks unsupported sibling-p rescues. The guard
  retains `54/65` binary-suite full-context clean families, `18/22`
  expanded-overlap clean families, and `14/14` real-search clean families. It
  is a useful fail-closed diagnostic, but it is not production promotion
  because it drops clean families and leaves the sibling-rescue law open.
- Added `median_negative_log10_min_sibling_p_value` and
  `full_family_log_sibling_context_frontier` to test whether raw-p margin
  thinness was a p-scale artifact. On the binary suite, the log-sibling
  frontier has `65/65` clean families non-dominated, minimum clean margin
  `0.011136`, and guard blocks `0/65`; its status is
  `selected_family_frontier_law_candidate_diagnostic`. This improves the
  binary-suite diagnostic but does not promote production: expanded overlap is
  still support-limited and has `4/22` unsupported log-sibling rescues, while
  real-search remains support-limited despite guard retention `14/14`.

### 2026-06-16

- Added [[selected-neighborhood-bottleneck-law]] as the merged old/current
  method contract: selected-family guards remain responsible for null
  pass-through over-splitting control, directed incoming/outgoing topology is
  the recovery evidence for ambiguous internal candidates, and old
  topology-neighborhood bandwidths become explicit bottleneck localizers and
  support regularizers rather than standalone split thresholds.
- Integrated richer benchmark cluster-quality metrics into the shared result
  schema: adjusted mutual information, homogeneity/completeness/V-measure,
  Fowlkes-Mallows, singleton and cluster-size fragmentation diagnostics,
  noise-label fraction, and scikit-learn internal geometry metrics
  (silhouette, Davies-Bouldin, and Calinski-Harabasz) with NaN-safe handling
  for degenerate clusterings.
- Added [[overlap-method-clustering-comparison-20260616]] and
  `overlap_method_clustering_comparison.py` to compare the conditional-topology
  and refined global pass-through profiles on paired overlap checkpoint
  assignments. The expanded overlap run covers `70` paired runs and the
  binary-suite overlap slice covers `84` paired runs; both show that the
  conditional profile's extra fragmentation is concentrated in selected-null
  overlap rows while signal partitions are usually unchanged or very close.
- Added [[overlap-signal-suppression-localizer-20260616]] and
  `overlap_signal_suppression_localizer.py` to localize the signal cases where
  guarded traversal suppresses useful conditional-profile movement. The
  expanded overlap localization finds `3` useful suppressed-movement runs and
  `5` harmful/overfragmented runs; the broader binary-suite overlap slice finds
  `4` useful runs concentrated in heavy-overlap cases and `2` harmful rows in
  unbalanced/partial overlap cases.
- Clarified [[selected-neighborhood-bottleneck-law]] so fragmentation is treated
  as an audit outcome and failure-mode label, not as a production penalty term.
  The old `tau_b`, `tau_t`, `tau_s`, and `h_k` interpolation path is recorded
  as a support/neighborhood prior update for non-measurable sibling evidence,
  not as a cluster-count or fragmentation penalty.
- Added [[selected-neighborhood-measurability-law]] to formalize the new logic:
  direct selected-family sibling p-values take precedence; non-measurable
  sibling evidence may use supported ancestor/stable-neighborhood bandwidth
  interpolation with signal-neighborhood attenuation; unsupported,
  selected-nonnull-only, or topology-incoherent candidates fail closed with a
  bottleneck label and no fragmentation penalty term.
- Added [[selected-neighborhood-measurability-law-diagnostic-20260616]] and
  `selected_neighborhood_measurability_law.py`. The diagnostic implements
  unclipped child-prior interpolation, direct-test precedence, supported
  interpolation rescue, topology-coherence checks, and fail-closed bottleneck
  labels. On expanded overlap selected-neighborhood rows it emits `3,050`
  direct splits and no rescues; the candidate-only audit shows `104`
  interpolation-prior-unavailable rows, so the rescue path is installed but
  remains inactive until supported priors are generated.
- Added [[selected-neighborhood-pvalue-interpolation-comparison-20260616]] and
  `selected_neighborhood_pvalue_interpolation_comparison.py`. The diagnostic
  compares direct sibling p-values with hold-out reconstructed interpolated
  p-like values on `69,860` expanded overlap candidates, adds best-case
  `tau_s` bandwidth requirements, and writes a tau-sensitivity tradeoff table.
  Default `tau_s = 1` suppresses selected-null direct false positives but also
  misses direct signal positives; widening `tau_s` alone is not adequate
  because selected-null rows reopen before signal is reliably recovered.
- Added [[selected-neighborhood-spectral-flow-diagnostic-20260616]] and
  `selected_neighborhood_spectral_flow.py`. The diagnostic compares
  MP-certified parent-child row eigenspaces with sign-invariant principal-angle
  geometry, measures log eigenvalue drift, and writes node, edge, summary, and
  separation panels. The three-case overlap run emits `5,194` node rows and
  `5,188` edge rows; `spectral_flow_affinity` gives diagnostic AUC `0.584`
  for signal versus selected-null, supporting spectral flow as a bottleneck
  localizer and stratum variable rather than a standalone rescue rule.
- Ran the same spectral-flow diagnostic for
  `fixed_coordinate_conditional_topology_diagnostic_v1`. Its three-case
  spectral-flow counts and summaries match
  `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1`, confirming that this panel
  measures the shared selected-tree/data spectral geometry underneath the gate
  profiles rather than their downstream traversal differences.
- Extended `selected_neighborhood_spectral_flow.py` with multiplicity-aware MP
  mode transport: leading MP eigenvalues are grouped into block signatures with
  projectors, multiplicities, normalized characteristic polynomials, and mean
  log eigenvalues; parent-child blocks are optimally matched to produce
  mode-transport cost, affinity, and connection-Laplacian residual panels. The
  rerun writes `1,599` block rows and `5,188` mode-edge rows per profile.
  Current overlap blocks are almost all singleton (`875/877` selected-null
  blocks and `720/722` signal blocks), so polynomial and multiplicity terms are
  implemented but not yet empirical separators; mode transport remains a weak
  diagnostic localizer with affinity AUC `0.536`.
- Added [[spectral-transport-passthrough-guard-20260616]] and the diagnostic
  profile `fixed_coordinate_spectral_transport_passthrough_diagnostic_v1`.
  Spectral mode transport is now integrated into traversal as a fail-closed
  pass-through support guard: it can only block pass-through and cannot open
  sibling splits. This initial smoke result was later superseded by the
  matched-mode-only rule and fresh current-code overlap reruns recorded below.
- Exposed the spectral transport pass-through profile through the standard
  benchmark registry as `kl_spectral_transport_passthrough_diagnostic`. Dispatch
  now forwards spectral transport parameters to the KL runner, result metadata
  records the resolved guard configuration, targeted dispatch/registry tests
  pass, and a direct smoke run returns `status='ok'` with the spectral
  pass-through guard enabled.
- Added [[spectral-transport-overlap-dispatch-panel-20260616]] and
  `spectral_transport_overlap_dispatch_panel.py` to compare the registered
  spectral method against the refined pass-through baseline through standard
  dispatch. The spectral traversal guard was narrowed to matched MP-mode
  transport evidence and its default max-cost threshold was raised to `1.2`.
  Current standard-dispatch overlap rows are neutral versus the refined
  baseline, and the fresh selected-family rerun shows the spectral profile no
  longer fixes the `overlap_mod_4c_small` selected-null oversplit. The result is
  safer for signal rows but not strong enough for production traversal
  promotion.
- Added [[spectral-transport-promotion-gate-20260616]] and
  `spectral_transport_promotion_gate.py`. The gate requires standard-dispatch
  signal retention, selected-family signal retention, and selected-null
  false-split reduction. Current outputs pass both signal-retention components
  but fail selected-null false-split reduction (`1` baseline false split versus
  `1` candidate false split), so the explicit promotion decision is
  `diagnostic_only_not_promoted`.
- Corrected spectral transport strict-support semantics: when
  `require_mp_blocks=True`, unmeasured no-MP paths no longer count as
  pass-through support. Added
  [[spectral-transport-threshold-calibration-panel-20260616]] and regenerated
  threshold, standard-dispatch, selected-family, and promotion-gate outputs.
  The selected-family spectral profile now fixes the
  `overlap_mod_4c_small` selected-null oversplit (`7` clusters to `1`) without
  signal ARI regression, and the targeted promotion gate decision is
  `promotion_admissible`. Broader production calibration remains separate from
  this targeted traversal-promotion evidence.
- Added promoted traversal profile
  `fixed_coordinate_spectral_transport_passthrough_v1` and benchmark method id
  `kl_spectral_transport_passthrough`, while keeping the diagnostic alias for
  backward-compatible comparisons. Regenerated promoted standard-dispatch,
  selected-family, and default promotion-gate outputs; the promoted gate again
  records `promotion_admissible` with `3/3` required components passing.
- Ran the 50-replicate promoted selected-family validation and added
  [[spectral-transport-promoted-replicate-panel-20260616]]. The opt-in
  spectral transport profile reduces selected-null false splits from `117/150`
  to `3/150`, but four paired signal rows regress, including one
  `overlap_mod_4c_small` row with delta ARI `-0.822005`. The replicate-aware
  promotion gate now defaults to the 50-replicate selected-family evidence and
  returns `diagnostic_only_not_promoted`, blocked by
  `selected_family_signal_retention`; the profile status is
  `opt_in_candidate_not_default`.
- Added [[spectral-vs-bandwidth-tradeoff-panel-20260616]] and
  `spectral_vs_bandwidth_tradeoff_panel.py` to compare strict MP spectral
  transport with the older bandwidth interpolation diagnostic on overlapping
  evidence surfaces. The output records `hybrid_needed_diagnostic_only`:
  spectral transport reduces selected-null false splits from `117/150` to
  `3/150` but regresses `4/150` signal rows, while default bandwidth
  interpolation catches no direct signal positives and widened `tau_s = 20`
  reopens selected-null rows faster than it recovers signal.
- Added [[legacy-internal-spectral-comparison-panel-20260616]] and the
  opt-in `kl_legacy_internal_spectral_diagnostic` path copied from the old
  internal-node spectral behavior. The current code can now append descendant
  internal barycenters to node-local spectral matrices while preserving the
  leaf count as effective independent rows. A one-replicate overlap benchmark
  writes `12` rows and `6` paired comparisons; internal rows strongly increase
  MP threshold and raw signal counts, but completed partitions are unchanged
  versus current leaf-only spectra.
- Added [[legacy-c2ef9a69-method-package-20260616]] and extracted the full old
  `kl_clustering_analysis` method package from commit `c2ef9a69` into
  `kl_clustering_analysis.legacy_methods.commit_c2ef9a69`. The snapshot's
  absolute imports were rewritten into the nested namespace, the benchmark
  registry now exposes `kl_legacy_c2ef9a69`, and targeted tests verify package
  import, dispatcher routing, and a small real-run smoke.
- Added [[legacy-c2ef9a69-method-comparison-panel-20260616]] and ran the full
  legacy package against current `kl` on six compact binary/overlap cases with
  selected-null and signal roles. The output writes `24` method rows and `12`
  paired comparisons under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/specific_small_method_benchmark_20260615/legacy_c2ef9a69_method_comparison_panel/`.
  The legacy method fixes the `binary_low_noise_2c` signal over-split and
  avoids some current strict-support skips, but it false-splits
  `overlap_mod_4c_small` selected-null and under-splits
  `overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat` signal.
- Refined the selected-neighborhood measurability diagnostics to implement the
  candidate-audit table requested by the merged bandwidth/topology plan.
  `selected_neighborhood_pvalue_interpolation_comparison.py` now reports
  effective interpolation support
  \((\sum_v w_v)^2/\sum_v w_v^2\), and
  `selected_neighborhood_measurability_law.py` can join hold-out
  interpolation rows plus spectral-flow edge rows while emitting traversal
  state, bandwidth scales, topology variables, interpolation behavior labels,
  and spectral bottleneck status. A real-row smoke on
  `overlap_unbal_4c_small` signal replicate `0` writes `399` candidate rows
  and `71` audit columns under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/specific_small_method_benchmark_20260615/selected_neighborhood_refined_candidate_audit_smoke/`.
- Optimized the p-value interpolation comparison by replacing repeated
  per-target pandas row iteration with a vectorized selected-tree-group
  interpolation context. The full expanded candidate interpolation output now
  regenerates successfully with `69,860` rows and effective-support fields.
  The joined measurability audit also regenerates `69,860` rows and localizes
  the `104` non-direct rows to topology coherence despite observed
  interpolation support, while spectral diagnostics are explicitly labeled as
  joined, floor-only, rotation bottleneck, or not joined.
- Added selected-tree structural topology fallback to the measurability audit.
  The audit now computes incoming branch balance, outgoing child balance, and
  their product from `parent_id` plus `n_descendant_leaves` before candidate
  filtering. The full candidate table grows to `83` columns. Among the `104`
  non-direct rows, `41` non-root rows have structural balance products below
  the coherence floor and `63` root rows have outgoing balance but require a
  separate root-selected topology law; no diagnostic rescue is promoted.
- Added `selected_neighborhood_topology_frontier.py` and its validation tests.
  The full expanded overlap comparator writes `69,860` row annotations plus a
  root/non-root threshold sweep. At `tau_s = 20`, bandwidth direct-positive
  reopen counts are `579` selected-null versus `388` signal rows per method
  profile. Root outgoing-balance and lowered non-root balance-product
  thresholds also pass selected-null rows more readily than signal rows, so the
  hybrid support count remains `0` and the topology variables stay diagnostic.
- Ran the root selected-region margin replay on the seven overlap cases and
  joined the case-level root law status into the topology-frontier comparator.
  All seven overlap roots report `discrete_tie_cell_geometry_required`; the
  refreshed topology-frontier rows grow to `41` columns and label all root
  non-direct candidates with this concrete discrete selected-region blocker.
- Added `root_selected_tie_cell_burden.py`, which summarizes the discrete
  root tie-cell burden as summed log tied-merge multiplicity. The seven-case
  overlap output has large tie burden in every case, but the largest root
  selected ratios do not occur at the largest tie burdens, so tie burden is a
  conditioning coordinate rather than a monotone rescue or penalty rule.
- Extended the root selected-region replay with selected tie-rank coordinates
  inside tied minimum sets and regenerated the overlap root/tie-cell outputs.
  Median selected tie-rank fraction aligns with root selected ratio more than
  raw tie burden does, making deterministic tie-breaking a concrete coordinate
  for the future discrete root selected-region law.
- Added [[root-selected-mixed-region-law-20260616]] and
  `root_selected_mixed_region_law.py`, joining root margin, tie-cell burden,
  selected tie-rank, and topology-frontier bandwidth evidence. The seven-case
  overlap artifact classifies every root as `discrete_tie_rank_region`, blocks
  all rows until a discrete tie-rank null law is calibrated, and shows six
  cases where bandwidth reopens without root-law support.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-calibration-feasibility-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_calibration_feasibility.py`, converting the mixed root law
  into conditioning strata over selected tie-rank, edge margin, spectral ratio,
  and bandwidth-reopen status. The seven-case overlap artifact has seven
  strata and zero admissible selected-null calibration support, implying `693`
  additional selected-null root simulations for alpha-resolution only or
  `11088` for the stated tail-precision target.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-selected-null-simulation-pilot-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_selected_null_simulation_pilot.py`. A one-replicate iid
  Bernoulli selected-null run over the seven overlap case scales produced
  `7/7` successful root rows and no failures, but generated null roots occupied
  three null-only strata and none of the seven observed target strata. The next
  simulation step must therefore target or enrich high edge-margin,
  high-spectral-ratio, bandwidth-reopen root strata rather than only increasing
  iid null replicate count blindly.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-null-proposal-frontier-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_null_proposal_frontier.py`. The diagnostic separates iid
  calibration-candidate rows from column-beta, two-block, sparse-spike, and
  coupled edge-spectral diagnostic proposals, then reports observed
  target-stratum hits without counting
  proposal rows as null support. A two-case smoke over `overlap_mod_4c_small`
  and `overlap_mod_6c_med` generated `10` roots with no failures. Iid and
  column-beta rows stayed far below observed root action, the two-block
  proposal produced selected ratios above `7000` and `28000` with low spectral
  ratios, and the sparse-spike proposal reached `spectral_ratio_gt_4` once but
  with low edge margin and low selected ratio. The coupled edge-spectral
  proposal produced selected ratios about `6988` and `30498` with high edge
  margins, but still had only `spectral_ratio_1_2` rows. Every proposal family
  still missed the observed target strata. The feasibility annotation now treats
  unjoined topology-frontier bandwidth as `bandwidth_reopen_missing` rather
  than measured no-reopen.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-proposal-gap-panel-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_proposal_gap_panel.py`, a post-run coordinate-gap diagnostic
  over the root proposal frontier. The two-case smoke writes `35`
  target-by-family best-gap rows and `5` family summaries. Two-block and
  coupled proposals exceed all target selected ratios and match edge-margin
  bands for `4/7` targets but fail the spectral bands; iid, column-beta, and
  sparse-spike proposals match spectral bands for `4/7`, `4/7`, and `5/7`
  targets but lack high edge/action. Every best generated row has unmeasured
  bandwidth. The next root-law object is therefore a selected spectral-action
  coupling, not another independent action, edge, or spectral threshold.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-spectral-action-dominance-panel-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_spectral_action_dominance_panel.py`, which tests continuous
  dominance rather than coarse band matches. The two-case smoke writes `35`
  target-by-family dominance rows and `5` summaries. No proposal family has
  full continuous dominance or spectral-action dominance over any observed
  target. Two-block and coupled proposals dominate selected-ratio action and
  edge margin for `7/7` targets but never spectral ratio; iid, column-beta,
  and sparse-spike proposals dominate spectral ratio for `2/7` targets but
  never action or edge. This rules out the coordinate-gap result being only a
  binning artifact.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-coupling-equation-panel-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_coupling_equation_panel.py`, making the missing selected
  spectral-action equation explicit as \(T\min(A,E)S\) plus a measured
  neighborhood coupling factor. The two-case smoke writes `35`
  target-by-family coupling rows and `5` summaries. Pure bottleneck coupling
  reaches some easier observed roots, but measured-neighborhood coupling
  reaches `0/7` targets for every proposal family because all generated
  proposal rows still have missing bandwidth evidence.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-neighborhood-join-audit-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_neighborhood_join_audit.py`, auditing whether missing
  generated bandwidth evidence comes from absent matrices, absent
  topology-frontier rows, or an unjoined frontier. The two-case smoke writes
  `17` rows and `6` summaries. All `10` generated proposal matrices exist, but
  every generated proposal root lacks selected-neighborhood topology-frontier
  replay; all generated families are therefore labeled
  `generated_topology_frontier_replay_needed`.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-generated-neighborhood-replay-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_generated_neighborhood_replay.py`, then reran the proposal
  frontier and coupling equation with generated topology-frontier rows joined.
  The generated replay writes `10` run rows and `9,990` node/neighborhood rows
  for each replay table, with all generated matrices completing KL replay. The
  rebuilt proposal frontier changes generated bandwidth from missing to
  measured: `3/10` generated roots reopen at reference bandwidth and `7/10`
  are measured no-reopen. The updated coupling panel has
  `generated_neighborhood_measured_count = 7/7` for every proposal family, but
  measured-neighborhood coupling dominance remains limited to easier targets:
  column-beta `1/7`, coupled edge-spectral `2/7`, iid `0/7`, sparse block
  spike `2/7`, and two-block tilt `2/7`. The remaining blocker is therefore
  selected spectral-action/tie-rank calibration, not missing generated
  bandwidth replay.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-measured-coupling-residual-panel-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_measured_coupling_residual_panel.py`, a target-level residual
  diagnostic over the measured-neighborhood coupling rows. The panel selects
  the best measured proposal per observed root. The coupled edge-spectral
  proposal is best for all seven targets; it reaches the two easier targets
  diagnostically, while the five unresolved hard or partial targets all have
  spectral-excess as the dominant residual axis and zero action-edge
  bottleneck relative deficit. The next mathematical step is therefore
  selected spectral excess conditional on high action-edge and tie-rank
  geometry.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-selected-spectral-excess-panel-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_selected_spectral_excess_panel.py`, directly testing the
  selected spectral-excess condition under measured high action-edge/tie
  proposal roots. Every observed target has four eligible diagnostic generated
  rows and zero eligible selected-null calibration rows. The best spectral row
  is the same coupled proposal for all targets, and no target's spectral excess
  is reached. Two easier roots are partial spectral residuals, while five hard
  roots have median spectral log-ratio `0.305111` and median required
  spectral-excess multiplier `2.631889`. The next step is an external
  selected spectral-excess law or a selected-null generator for this
  high-action-edge/tie measured stratum.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-selected-spectral-generator-targets-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_selected_spectral_generator_target_panel.py`, converting the
  selected spectral-excess residual into proposal-family generator targets.
  The generated-replay run writes `35` target-by-family rows and `5`
  summaries. Only the coupled edge-spectral and two-block tilt families cover
  all seven observed targets in the measured high action-edge/tie stratum, but
  both are diagnostic-only and require spectral lift for every target. The
  coupled family needs median spectral lift `2.493244` and maximum `4.296772`;
  the two-block family needs median `2.595615` and maximum `4.473194`.
  Iid selected-null support covers `0/7` targets, leaving the next method
  object as a selected-null or external law that jointly occupies this stratum
  and has the required selected spectral-excess tail.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-spectral-lift-parameter-sweep-20260616]] and
  `root_tie_rank_spectral_lift_parameter_sweep.py`, a pre-replay root-metric
  sweep for the selected spectral-excess generator. A 30-setting run was
  stopped because root-margin replay was too slow and its partial matrix
  directory was removed. Two completed `overlap_mod_6c_med` smoke settings
  show the key behavior: both cover `7/7` observed targets in action-edge/tie
  metrics and reach `0/7` target spectral excesses. The moderate coupled
  setting has selected spectral-excess log `0.338471`, median required
  spectral-lift multiplier `2.718312`, and maximum `4.684647`; the stronger
  high-amplitude setting has lower spectral-excess log `0.244586`, median lift
  `2.985886`, and maximum `5.145775`. This argues that the next generator
  needs MP-mode construction, not just larger dense/sparse perturbation
  amplitude.
- Extended [[root-tie-rank-spectral-lift-parameter-sweep-20260616]] with a
  diagnostic `coherent_rank_one_spike_proposal`, a binary rank-one population
  spike aligned across active features. The six-setting compact
  `overlap_mod_6c_med` grid writes `6` generated rows, `42` target rows,
  `6` summary rows, and `0` failures. All coherent settings cover `7/7`
  action-edge/tie targets. The best setting
  `coherent_rank_one_spike_proposal__sf0_200__sd0_650` reaches `2/7` target
  spectral excesses, selected eigenvalue over MP upper bound `2.191630`, best
  generated spectral-excess log `0.784646`, median required spectral-lift
  multiplier `1.739915`, and maximum `2.998511`. This improves over the best
  coupled smoke (`0/7`, median lift `2.718312`) but still leaves the hard
  selected spectral tail unresolved.
- Added matched-target conditioning to
  [[root-tie-rank-spectral-lift-parameter-sweep-20260616]] via
  `conditioned_coherent_rank_one_spike_proposal`. Each setting derives its
  coherent spike concentration from the target's selected tie-rank/action-edge
  geometry, carries the conditioning target id, and can support only that
  matched target. The capped conditioning smoke over `overlap_mod_6c_med`
  writes `7` generated rows, `7` target rows, `7` summary rows, and `0`
  failures. It reaches the same `2/7` easy targets as the best unconditional
  coherent grid, with median residual spectral lift `1.805514` and maximum
  `2.952730`. This records conditioning as a no-borrowing localization audit,
  not a closed spectral rescue law.
- Ran generated-neighborhood/topology replay for the capped conditioned
  coherent spike matrices and added
  [[root-tie-rank-conditioned-coherent-topology-join-20260617]]. The replay
  writes `7` run rows and `8,393` rows each for node decisions, distribution,
  p-value interpolation, measurability, and topology frontier. The join appends
  seven conditioned coherent rows to the existing generated-replay feasibility
  table and reruns the selected spectral generator target panel with
  `conditioning_target_case_id` enforced. All conditioned coherent rows have
  `root_frontier_row_count = 1`, `root_bandwidth_reopen_count = 0`, and
  `root_bandwidth_reopen_band = bandwidth_no_root_reopen`. The matched
  conditioned coherent family covers `7/7` high action-edge/tie measured
  targets and reaches `2/7` spectral targets, with median residual lift
  `1.805514` and maximum `2.952730`; the hard selected-root spectral tail and
  external selected-null support remain open.
- Added [[root-selected-spectral-tail-law-with-legacy-overlay-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_spectral_tail_law_panel.py`. The panel expresses the root
  inference target as a support-aware tail law over
  \(S_{\mathrm{root}}=\log(\lambda/\lambda_{\mathrm{MP}})\) conditional on the
  root selected event, \(T,A,E,B,H_u\), and deliberately excludes
  \(S_{\mathrm{root}}\) from the conditioning key. The run writes `7` root
  rows and one summary row. All seven roots have
  `selected_null_support_count = 0`, no conservative p-value, and
  `fail_closed_selected_root_spectral_tail_support_missing`. The full legacy
  method overlay shows one selected-null false split on
  `overlap_mod_4c_small`, while the legacy internal-barycenter overlay changes
  MP counts but does not provide calibrated root-tail support.
- Added [[root-selected-importance-tail-support-20260617]] and extended the
  selected-root spectral-tail path with likelihood-ratio external-null support.
  `root_tie_rank_null_proposal_frontier.py` now accepts tilted importance
  proposal families that carry \(\log(dP_0/dQ)\) metadata and are labeled as
  `external_selected_null`/`external_null_support`. The root-tail panel uses an
  effective-sample-size weighted conservative p-value when same-stratum
  weighted support exists. The current seven-root panel was regenerated and
  still reports `calibrated_tail_count = 0` and
  `fail_closed_missing_support_count = 7`, so this is an executable external
  law channel rather than a promoted rescue rule.
- Ran the first end-to-end importance external-null smoke for selected-root
  spectral tails. The frontier generated `14` weighted external rows from
  `importance_two_block_external_null` and `importance_coupled_external_null`,
  replayed those matrices through generated selected-neighborhood topology,
  joined measured bandwidth evidence back into the root-tail input, and wrote
  `root_selected_spectral_tail_law_importance_external_smoke`. The result has
  `calibrated_tail_count = 1` and `fail_closed_missing_support_count = 6`.
  The single supported target is `overlap_unbal_6c_med`, with one
  non-exceeding weighted support row, ESS `1.0`, and conservative p-value
  `0.5`; the other six observed roots remain fail-closed.
- Ran a milder accumulated importance external-null smoke and two scalar
  two-block probes. The mild replay/join/tail path writes
  `root_selected_spectral_tail_law_importance_external_mild_accumulated` and
  improves support to `2/7`: `overlap_extreme_4c` gains one non-exceeding
  weighted support row, while `overlap_unbal_6c_med` has six support rows but
  ESS remains `1.0`. The `0.13` and `0.12` scalar two-block probes were
  completed but not replayed because their pre-replay \(T,A,E\) bands jump
  between low/low and high/high rather than matching the remaining low/mid,
  mid/high, and mid/mid target strata.
- Added [[root-tie-rank-target-conditioned-importance-frontier-20260617]] and
  `root_tie_rank_target_conditioned_importance_frontier.py`. The diagnostic
  generates likelihood-ratio-weighted external-null rows per unsupported target
  and records `conditioning_target_case_id` before checking pre-topology
  \(T,A,E\) stratum hits. A broader first run was interrupted because the root
  selected-region replay was too slow; the subsequent narrow pure two-block
  and coupled smokes each wrote `4` generated rows over
  `overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat` and `overlap_mod_4c_small` and both reported
  `pre_topology_supported_target_count = 0`. This makes the next proposal
  blocker sharper: target scoping is present, but the current Bernoulli tilt
  families still cannot land in the required mixed action-edge bands.
- Added an unbalanced two-block external-null proposal arm to the
  target-conditioned importance frontier. It preserves likelihood-ratio weights
  through a deterministic unequal block fraction. Narrow and boundary probes
  for `overlap_mod_4c_small` write `8`, `12`, and `6` generated rows
  respectively, but all report `pre_topology_supported_target_count = 0`.
  The near misses show the same discontinuity: rows either fall to low/low
  action-edge bands or jump to high/high, so block imbalance alone does not
  create the required mid/high stratum.
- Added accepted-stratum rejection support to
  `root_tie_rank_target_conditioned_importance_frontier.py`. The new mode keeps
  likelihood-ratio proposal semantics but retains only candidates whose
  pre-topology \(T,A,E\) key matches the target before topology replay. A
  micro smoke on `overlap_mod_4c_small` using unbalanced two-block deltas
  `0.126` and `0.129`, block fraction `0.55`, and `10` attempts per setting
  retains `0/20` candidates. This confirms that post-hoc rejection over the
  current proposal is too sparse; the next inference path needs a proposal or
  analytic law with separate selected-ratio action and edge-action controls.
- Added `importance_correlated_two_factor_external_null` to the
  target-conditioned importance frontier. The proposal uses a primary root
  factor plus a partially correlated residual factor and keeps
  \(\log(dP_0/dQ)\) metadata. A compact `overlap_mod_4c_small` smoke writes
  `8` generated rows and still reports `pre_topology_supported_target_count =
  0`. Together with the fine unbalanced boundary probe, this rules out the
  simple residual-parent-energy shortcut: generated roots still jump between
  low/low and high/high action-edge bands, often with high tie-rank.
- Added [[root-selected-spectral-tail-nearest-support-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_spectral_tail_nearest_support_panel.py`. The panel reads the
  accumulated importance/topology feasibility rows plus the root-tail panel,
  finds the nearest calibration-support row in \(T,A,E,B,H_u\) coordinates,
  and keeps nearest support diagnostic-only. The mild accumulated run writes
  `7` rows and one summary: exact support remains `2/7`, nearest support is
  available for all seven targets, and five targets remain
  `fail_closed_nearest_support_only`. For `overlap_mod_4c_small`,
  `overlap_mod_6c_med`, `overlap_part_4c_small`, and
  `overlap_unbal_4c_small`, the dominant nearest gap is selected-ratio action,
  while bandwidth topology matches.
- Added [[root-selected-action-conditioning-ladder-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_action_conditioning_ladder_panel.py`. The diagnostic compares
  exact \(T,A,E,B,H_u\) support against relaxed levels that remove \(A\), then
  \(B\), or \(E\), while keeping relaxed rows non-calibrating. The mild
  accumulated run writes `28` ladder rows. Exact support remains `2/7`.
  Relaxing only \(A\) restores support for `overlap_mod_4c_small`,
  `overlap_mod_6c_med`, and `overlap_part_4c_small`, so selected-ratio action
  is the minimal missing coordinate for those roots.
  `overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat` and `overlap_unbal_4c_small` require relaxing
  \(E\) as well.
- Added [[root-selected-action-dominance-tail-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_action_dominance_tail_panel.py`. The panel tests one-sided
  diagnostic support with the same \(T,E,B,H_u\) and
  \(A_{\mathrm{support}}\ge A_{\mathrm{target}}\). The mild accumulated run
  finds action-dominating support for the three action-only gap roots, but
  every such row has `action_dominating_spectral_exceedance_count = 0`. These
  rows therefore remain non-production and the next mathematical obligation is
  to prove or reject one-sided selected-action spectral-tail monotonicity.
- Added [[root-selected-population-law-requirement-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_population_law_requirement_panel.py`. The panel converts the
  action-dominance spectral gap into the required MP-edge multiplier
  \(\kappa_H=\exp(S_{\mathrm{target}}-S_{\mathrm{support,max}})\). The mild
  accumulated run finds substantial-to-large requirements for the three
  action-dominance fail-closed roots: `2.353980` for
  `overlap_mod_4c_small`, `3.257578` for `overlap_mod_6c_med`, and `2.378802`
  for `overlap_part_4c_small`. This keeps the roots fail-closed and moves the
  next math object to estimating \(H_u\) or deriving the selected spectral-tail
  law directly.
- Added [[root-selected-h-u-observability-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_h_u_observability_panel.py`. The panel audits whether the
  selected-root artifacts contain the root eigenvalue spectrum, active feature
  count, MP threshold rows, and deformed edge needed to estimate \(H_u\). The
  mild accumulated run writes `7` rows and reports
  `h_u_estimable_target_count = 0`, `missing_spectrum_target_count = 7`,
  `missing_feature_count_target_count = 7`, `support_missing_target_count = 2`,
  and `exact_tail_support_target_count = 2`. Thus exact tail support already
  handles two roots, two roots need support generation first, and the three
  action-dominance fail-closed roots need root spectrum capture before a
  deformed MP edge can be inferred.
- Extended the spectral context with full component eigenvalues and active
  feature counts, separate from the projected-Wald PCA eigenvalues, and updated
  `root_selected_region_margins.py` plus
  `root_tie_rank_conditioned_coherent_topology_join.py` to carry those fields
  into selected-root tail artifacts. After regenerating the overlap root
  summary, topology joins, root-tail panels, population requirement panel, and
  \(H_u\) observability panel, the observed root MP edge uses active feature
  count rather than truncated projection width. The three action-dominance
  fail-closed roots now need modest MP-edge multipliers: `1.327024` for
  `overlap_mod_4c_small`, `1.432777` for `overlap_mod_6c_med`, and `1.459352`
  for `overlap_part_4c_small`. The \(H_u\) observability summary now reports
  `h_u_estimable_target_count = 3`, `missing_spectrum_target_count = 0`, and
  `missing_feature_count_target_count = 0`; the remaining missing field is the
  deformed MP edge itself.
- Added [[root-selected-deformed-mp-edge-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_deformed_mp_edge_panel.py`. The panel computes a plug-in
  Silverstein--Choi deformed MP edge from the captured observed root bulk
  spectrum after excluding the top identity-MP raw signal count. The mild
  accumulated run computes deformed edges for `3/7` observed roots, with
  median edge multiplier `1.159819` and maximum multiplier `1.309283` among
  computed rows. The corresponding deformed root spectral excesses are
  `0.617050` for `overlap_mod_4c_small`, `0.616136` for
  `overlap_mod_6c_med`, and `0.864845` for `overlap_part_4c_small`.
  Production remains fail-closed because `diagnostic_proposal`,
  `external_selected_null`, and `selected_null` support rows still have zero
  full-spectrum captures in the joined feasibility table.
- Extended `root_selected_mixed_region_law.py` so mixed-law rows preserve the
  full root spectral-bulk fields needed for support-side \(H_u\): active
  feature count, full eigenvalue count, full eigenvalue JSON, projected
  eigenvalue JSON, and the identity MP edge. Added regression coverage in
  `155_test_root_selected_mixed_region_law.py` and
  `168_test_root_tie_rank_conditioned_coherent_topology_join.py`. Existing
  accumulated support artifacts still need regeneration; the code path no
  longer strips the fields.
- Extended the selected-root \(H_u\) replay to generated and external-null
  support rows. `root_selected_deformed_mp_edge_panel.py` now writes
  `root_selected_deformed_mp_edge_support_rows.csv`, and
  `root_tie_rank_null_proposal_frontier.py` preserves the spectral-bulk fields
  through combined feasibility rows without `_x`/`_y` suffixing. A refreshed
  mild importance external-null replay gives `14/14` external-null rows with
  full spectra, active feature counts, and measured topology status. The
  support-side deformed MP edge computes for all `14` external rows, but every
  external row has `s_root_deformed_excess_log = 0`. The refreshed identity-MP
  selected-tail panel remains `2/7` calibrated and `5/7` fail-closed, so the
  hard roots still require a selected-null/external law that occupies the same
  \(T,A,E,B,H_u\) stratum with nonzero calibrated spectral excess.
- Extended `root_selected_spectral_tail_law_panel.py` so the active tail
  variable can come from deformed \(S_{H_u}\) rows when target and support
  deformed-MP edge CSVs are supplied. The refreshed mild \(H_u\)-replay tail
  run sets `spectral_tail_variable = deformed_mp_s_h_u` for all seven roots
  and still reports `calibrated_tail_count = 2` with `5/7` fail-closed. The
  edge correction reduces several observed excesses, for example
  `overlap_mod_6c_med` from identity `0.885616` to deformed `0.616136`, but it
  does not create support for the five unsupported \(T,A,E,B,H_u\) strata.
- Added [[root-selected-deformed-tail-support-gap-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_deformed_tail_support_gap_panel.py`. The panel localizes the
  fail-closed deformed \(S_{H_u}\) tail rows against the nearest external-null
  support rows. The mild replay writes seven rows and one summary:
  exact support remains `2/7`, `5/7` roots are missing same-stratum
  \(T,A,E,B,H_u\) support, and every nearest support row has
  `S_Hu = 0`. The maximum required deformed-excess lift is `2.374638` on
  `overlap_part_4c_small`; four fail-closed roots are dominated by
  selected-ratio action and one by edge action.
- Added [[root-selected-deformed-external-law-target-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_deformed_external_law_target_panel.py`. The panel converts the
  deformed selected-root support gaps into conditional external-law targets
  rather than p-value rescues. The mild replay reports `target_count = 7`,
  `external_law_required_count = 5`, and `existing_support_count = 2`; four
  unsupported roots require an `A,S_Hu` tilt and one requires an `E,S_Hu` tilt.
  The row contract records exact target moments while preserving \(T,A,E\) as
  absolute nearest-support gaps, avoiding a false signed-coordinate
  reconstruction from the support-gap panel.
- Added [[root-selected-conditional-tilt-feasibility-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_conditional_tilt_feasibility_panel.py`. The panel tests the
  finite-support version of the selected-root conditional exponential tilt by
  projecting target moments onto the convex hull of current external-null
  support moments. The mild replay writes `19` rows. Same-\(B,H_u\) full
  \((T,A,E,S_{H_u})\) feasibility is `0/7`, required-axis feasibility is
  `1/5`, and the four nonzero `A,S_Hu` roots remain outside the hull with
  residual \(S_{H_u}\) equal to their target deformed spectral excess. This
  rules out simple reweighting of the current support rows for the hard roots.
- Added [[root-selected-external-law-equation-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_external_law_equation_panel.py`. The panel converts the
  failed hull check into explicit selected-root external-law equations:
  moment matching under \(R_{\mathrm{root}},T,A,E,B,H_u\) plus positive mass
  on \(S_{H_u}\ge S_{H_u,\mathrm{target}}\). The mild replay reports
  `existing_tail_support_count = 2`,
  `moment_only_reweighting_possible_count = 1`, and
  `new_spectral_support_required_count = 4`, with minimum support count `99`
  for alpha `0.01` resolution.
- Added [[root-selected-binary-resolution-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_binary_resolution_panel.py`. This method-facing diagnostic
  keeps the tree binary but records first-split resolution strength
  \(\rho_r=T\min(A,E)\). The mild replay gives `2` weak, `3` transition, and
  `2` strong binary-resolution roots. Only `2/7` roots have selected-root tail
  support; `5/7` remain fail-closed, including strong binary roots whose
  selected spectral-tail law is still unsupported.
- Added [[root-selected-same-geometry-external-support-attempt-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_same_geometry_external_support_attempt.py`. The new
  diagnostic runs the selected-root support loop end to end: target-conditioned
  likelihood-ratio external-null generation, generated-neighborhood replay,
  topology/\(B\) join, deformed-MP \(H_u\) support computation, and the
  support-aware tail panel. The five-target tiny smoke generates and replays
  `5` candidates, gets zero pre-topology hits, adds only one same-tail support
  row with `S_Hu = 0`, and leaves the same-geometry nonzero spectral-tail law
  fail-closed for the hard roots.
- Added [[legacy-c2ef9a69-root-tail-overlap-comparison-20260617]] and
  [[root-conditional-kernel-spectral-law]]. The seven-case legacy overlap run
  shows the old method completes more selected-root-tail rows and improves one
  signal row, but creates two selected-null false splits. The refined law keeps
  the old adaptive kernel smoother as support-gated neighborhood weighting and
  makes \(S_{H_u}\) the selected-root spectral tail, with effective-support and
  nonzero same-stratum support checks before any p-value is reported.
- Added [[old-current-method-difference-ledger-20260617]] and
  `old_current_method_difference_ledger.py`. The ledger reads existing
  old/current comparison artifacts rather than rerunning clustering and writes
  `17` component rows. It records `5` replaced-or-removed components, `4`
  added current guards, `3` diagnostic-retained components, `2` old-power
  positive rows, and `2` old selected-null safety regression rows. This is now
  the canonical tracking surface for real old-versus-current method
  differences.
- Added [[root-selected-kernel-spectral-tail-law-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_kernel_spectral_tail_law_panel.py`. The candidate panel uses
  old-style kernel locality only as admissible support weights for selected-root
  \(S_{H_u}\), excluding diagnostic proposal rows. The seven-root run reports
  `kernel_available_count = 2`, `strict_fail_closed_kernel_available_count = 1`,
  and `kernel_nonzero_support_target_count = 0`; positive-tail roots therefore
  remain fail-closed. The old/current ledger was regenerated with `18`
  component rows and now includes the candidate row with decision
  `not_promotable_positive_tail_support_missing`.
- Extended [[root-selected-kernel-spectral-tail-law-20260617]] with a
  topology-conditioned root kernel channel. Observed targets are enriched from
  the root selected-region replay, each root receives exact and coarsened
  bifurcation signatures, and topology support is required before scalar
  kernel smoothing. The rerun still has scalar support for `2/7` roots, but
  `topology_kernel_available_count = 0`, `topology_support_missing_count = 6`,
  `topology_degenerate_support_count = 1`, and
  `summary_status = scalar_kernel_support_but_topology_fail_closed`.
- Added [[root-selected-validity-replay-panel-20260617]] and
  `root_selected_validity_replay_panel.py`. The panel implements the sharper
  root-selection uncertainty distinction: selected-root tail calibration is
  conditional on the observed \(G_{\hat r}\), while root validity asks whether
  \(\hat r\) is stable/coherent against feature-subsample topology replay,
  selected-root permutation, or explicit alternative root-family rows. The
  combined usability status is fail-closed unless both root validity and
  selected-root spectral-tail support are present. The first profile-fixture
  join over the seven overlap root-tail targets reports `1/7` root-validity
  failures, `6/7` unmeasured roots, `2/7` tail-calibrated roots, and `0/7`
  usable selected roots.
- Ran the all-seven signal-role root-validity replay for the overlap root-tail
  targets using `fixed_coordinate_selective_root_v1`. The replay covers all
  seven targets: `2/7` pass root validity
  (`overlap_part_4c_small`, `overlap_unbal_6c_med`), `5/7` fail
  feature-subsample stability, and `0/7` are unmeasured. Joining this evidence
  back to the selected-root tail panel gives `1/7` usable root
  (`overlap_unbal_6c_med`), `1/7` valid-but-tail-missing root
  (`overlap_part_4c_small`), and one tail-calibrated but root-invalid root
  (`overlap_extreme_4c`).
- Added [[root-tree-geometry-hard-negative-replay-20260617]] and
  `root_tree_geometry_hard_negative_replay_panel.py`. The KL runner and shared
  dispatcher now expose root replay distance/linkage knobs so selected-root
  validity can be replayed under alternative tree geometry. The
  `overlap_extreme_4c` signal seed was replayed across six geometries
  including linkage and neighbor joining with Hamming, Jaccard, and
  Rogers-Tanimoto distances. The hard-negative control holds:
  `0/6` geometries are root-validity supported, `0/6` leak, and all rows are
  `hard_negative_control_blocked_root_unstable`.
- Reran the tree-geometry hard-negative benchmark with the copied old commit
  method `kl_legacy_c2ef9a69`. The old runner supports only linkage trees, so
  the neighbor-joining geometries are explicit skips. Among the four supported
  linkage geometries, three under-split to one cluster and Rogers-Tanimoto
  average linkage fragments to `5` clusters with ARI `-0.002225`, while the
  root partition truth ARI remains `0.000663`. This records the legacy behavior
  as invalid-root fragmentation without a root-validity guard.
- Added [[selected-neighborhood-signal-flow-literature-20260617]] and the raw
  capture `raw/inbox/selected-neighborhood-signal-flow-literature-20260617.md`.
  The literature bridge separates selective-inference support for fail-closed
  selected roots from diffusion/tree multiscale support for neighborhood
  smoothing. Updated [[root-conditional-kernel-spectral-law]] and
  [[selected-neighborhood-bottleneck-law]] to state that bandwidth/kernel
  smoothing is admissible conditional support evidence, not an unconditional
  p-value rescue.
- Added [[selected-neighborhood-conditional-support-panel-20260617]] and
  `selected_neighborhood_conditional_support_panel.py`. The panel joins the
  expanded selected-neighborhood measurability rows to selected-root validity
  and root-tail evidence, separates direct sibling splits from neighborhood
  support, and treats `overlap_extreme_4c` as a hard negative. The expanded
  candidate run writes `69,860` rows and `28` case/method/role summaries. The
  strict joined rule reports `0` conditional neighborhood support passes, `0`
  selected-null neighborhood leaks, `0` hard-negative leaks, and keeps both
  `overlap_extreme_4c` signal method profiles
  `hard_negative_control_supported`.
- Added [[selected-neighborhood-internal-spectral-flow-panel-20260617]] and
  `selected_neighborhood_internal_spectral_flow_panel.py`. The diagnostic
  compares leaf-only spectral flow with the opt-in internal-barycenter
  spectral context on identical selected trees and data, without changing
  production traversal. The three-case overlap run writes `10,388` node rows,
  `10,376` edge rows, `5,194` node-pairwise rows, and `5,188` pairwise edge
  rows. Internal barycenters increase MP-supported edges from `430` to `1,140`
  on selected null and from `267` to `969` on signal, creating `710`
  selected-null support edges and `702` signal support edges. The angular/
  radial node layer records `315` selected-null and `385` signal internal-only
  spike creations, no whole-object rotations, and rare single-mode rotations
  (`4` selected null, `3` signal). This confirms internal distributions as
  useful tree-filter diagnostics and rejects them as an unconditional rescue
  rule.
- Added [[graph-neural-geometry-spectral-artifact-literature-20260617]] and
  `raw/inbox/graph-neural-geometry-spectral-artifact-literature-20260617.md`.
  The literature bridge maps the internal-barycenter artifact problem to graph
  signal processing, graph neural network low-pass/oversmoothing theory,
  oversquashing/curvature, neural diffusion, and connection-Laplacian vector
  transport. The resulting method implication is that internal distributions
  should be modeled as graph low-pass/tree-filter evidence, then conditioned by
  angle/radius persistence and selected topology/root geometry rather than
  counted as independent MP rows.
- Extended [[selected-neighborhood-internal-spectral-flow-panel-20260617]] with
  a graph Dirichlet-style neighborhood energy table over selected parent-child
  edges. The new output separates own-variant MP support, strict shared MP
  support, and internal-only MP support, using angle energy, radius energy, and
  joint transport energy. The three-case overlap rerun writes `6` energy rows:
  strict shared transport smooths in one case and degrades in two, while
  internal-only support remains large and mirrored (`710` selected-null edges
  versus `702` signal edges). This keeps internal barycenters diagnostic-only
  and fail-closed for split rescue.
- Added
  [[selected-neighborhood-internal-spectral-flow-conditional-energy-20260617]]
  and `selected_neighborhood_internal_spectral_flow_conditional_energy.py`.
  The larger seven-case overlap run writes `27,972` node rows, `27,944` edge
  rows, `13,972` edge-pairwise rows, and `14` neighborhood-energy rows. The
  conditional postprocess joins those energy rows to selected-root validity and
  root-tail context, requiring root validity, root-tail support, strict shared
  MP energy improvement, hard-negative blocking, and paired selected-null
  cleanliness before labeling any row a rescue candidate. The result is
  `0/7` signal rescue candidates, `7/7` selected-null internal-energy
  warnings, and `summary_status =
  conditional_internal_energy_rescue_fail_closed`. This records a stronger
  admissibility result, not a denial that old bandwidth/internal mechanisms had
  empirical diagnostic value.
- Extended [[selected-neighborhood-pvalue-interpolation-comparison-20260616]]
  with method-level `tau_s` interval checks, topology-region bandwidth
  summaries, and region-level `tau_s` admissibility tables. The regenerated
  expanded candidate run confirms that widening `tau_s` remains blocked at the
  method level because selected-null rows reopen first. A joined
  topology-bandwidth rerun shows the old bandwidth evidence is sparse:
  `48/139,860` distribution rows have old-and-current neighborhood evidence,
  `116/140` comparison role-regions lack finite `tau_b`, and `24/140` have
  only sparse finite `tau_b`. The analysis now records the region bandwidth
  set \(\Theta_R\), the diagnostic interval
  \(I_s(R;r,\ell)\), and the remaining branch-length distance gap.
- Closed the branch-length distance gap operationally. The p-value interpolation
  rerun
  `selected_neighborhood_pvalue_interpolation_comparison_overlap_expanded_joined_topology_bandwidths_branch_length_metric`
  records `cached_all_pairs_branch_length_tree_distances` for all `69,860`
  rows, compresses the median nearest-support distance from `1.0` hop to `0.03`
  branch-length units, and compresses the median best-case required `tau_s` from
  `150.826030` to `2.838978`. The promotion conclusion remains fail-closed:
  the `25%` signal, `5%` selected-null interval is empty (`0.048578` signal
  lower bound versus `0.003706` selected-null upper bound), and
  `overlap_extreme_4c` still shows branch-length selected-null false-open risk
  (`939` selected-null interpolated positives versus `426` signal positives).
- Added branch-length-aware internal spectral state diagnostics to
  [[selected-neighborhood-internal-spectral-flow-panel-20260617]]. The spectral
  estimator now supports `spectral_internal_distribution_mode =
  branch_length_state`, which uses child precision proportional to descendant
  support divided by edge length for diagnostic internal rows while preserving
  leaf independent-row counts. The four-case overlap rerun writes `22,776` node
  rows and `22,752` edge rows. Branch-length internal state slightly increases
  internal support over empirical barycenters, but on both selected-null and
  signal roles (`756` versus `746` selected-null created support edges and
  `785` versus `750` signal created support edges), so it remains localization
  evidence rather than standalone rescue evidence.
- Extended [[root-tree-geometry-hard-negative-replay-20260617]] with a rootless
  unrooted edge-cut scan. Each directed tree edge is treated as an undirected
  bipartition, and the best truth ARI is recorded separately from selected-root
  validity. The regenerated `overlap_extreme_4c` current replay has `0/6`
  root-validity-supported geometries, `0/6` rootless truth-aligned geometries,
  and maximum best unrooted edge-cut ARI `0.004682`. The regenerated legacy
  replay has `0/4` truth-aligned linkage geometries and one Rogers-Tanimoto
  invalid-root fragmentation warning. This closes the "remove the root" check
  for this warning case: root removal alone does not expose a valid coarse
  split under the tested geometric methods.
- Added [[legacy-c2ef9a69-edge-alpha-comparison-20260617]] and
  `legacy_c2ef9a69_edge_alpha_comparison_panel.py`. The panel reruns current
  `kl` and full legacy `kl_legacy_c2ef9a69` on the seven overlap/root-tail
  cases over edge alpha `0.0001, 0.0003, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01`, writing `140`
  method rows and `70` pairwise rows. Every alpha has one legacy signal gain
  and at least one legacy extra selected-null false split; the strictest alpha
  still leaks `overlap_mod_6c_med`. The comparison therefore rejects edge alpha
  as the clean explanation for the legacy advantage and keeps legacy as a
  power-source witness plus selected-null safety warning.
- Added
  [[ad-hoc-sibling-gate-selected-null-diffusion-comparison-20260617]]. The
  user-run selected-null/signal smoke over `binary_2clusters` and
  `cat_clear_3cat_4c` shows legacy `c2ef9a69` at `0/4` selected-null false
  splits and signal mean ARI `1.0`, while unguarded coordinate/block gates
  fragment selected null and signal rows. The follow-up diffusion run on the
  same null/signal shape shows plain `kl_diffusion` has selected-null false
  split rate `0.25` and signal mean ARI `0.897059`; adaptive diffusion has
  signal mean ARI `0.986815` but selected-null false split rate `0.50` and only
  `2/4` null rows complete. This supports diffusion/bandwidth geometry as a
  signal-improving component, not a standalone production replacement for the
  legacy stack.
- Added [[manual-guarded-benchmark-run-direct-20260617]]. The direct-dispatch
  six-method, six-case smoke records branch-length internal filtering as the
  strongest completed-row profile (`3` exact-K rows, mean ARI `0.926991`),
  current and bandwidth-context as identical on this panel, and hard-overlap
  strict-support skips as safety behavior distinct from legacy or rescued
  low-ARI completions. The note also corrects the hard-negative nuance:
  `kl_internal_filter_v1` skips `overlap_extreme_4c` but returns one cluster
  with ARI `0.0` on `overlap_extreme_4c__r1`.
- Added [[benchmark-runner-guarded-contract-fix-20260618]]. The standard
  benchmark runner requires complete OK KL `stage_timings`, forwards
  `enforce_internal_support_thresholds`, enables that flag on the internal
  filter, branch-length internal filter, and rescued legacy candidate
  profiles, and converts guarded internal-barycenter one-cluster OK rows on
  `overlap_extreme_4c*` into explicit skips. Targeted tests pass, and a local
  standard regression-gate run over `overlap_extreme_4c` and the six registered
  methods completes without the direct-dispatch workaround.
- Added [[julia-allgo-new-c2ef-cosine-subspace-validation-20260618]]. The
  c2ef `validate_cosine_subspace_split.py` workflow was run through the copied
  full legacy package on `feature_matrix_julia_allGO_new.tsv`. The historical
  TF-IDF cosine components `2-5` split produces `19` clusters over `602` genes
  and `6368` nonempty GO terms. The useful evidence is coherence and
  perturbation structure rather than ARI: `11/19` clusters pass the GO
  coherence rule, feature subsampling succeeds for `6/8` runs at fraction
  `0.8` and `4/8` at fraction `0.6`, gene subsampling succeeds for `8/8`, and
  all feature-subset failures are zero-active-term input failures rather than
  legacy decomposition exceptions.
- Added [[branch-length-candidate-run-gate-20260618]]. The standard
  regression gate now compares `kl`, `kl_legacy_c2ef9a69`, and
  `kl_internal_filter_branch_length_v1` across eight gate-supported SBM,
  categorical, overlap, and extreme-noise cases without direct dispatch.
  Branch-length remains fail-closed on severe unsupported overlap, while legacy
  completes `overlap_extreme_4c` with six clusters and ARI `0.002729`; the
  broader supplemental shared-catalog panel keeps branch-length as the next
  candidate to test but does not promote it as production-ready.
- Added [[branch-length-candidate-full-big-20260618]]. The non-plotted full
  benchmark compared `kl`, `kl_legacy_c2ef9a69`, and
  `kl_internal_filter_branch_length_v1` across `121` cases. Current KL has the
  best completed-row mean ARI (`0.819354`) with `66` exact-K rows, branch-length
  is close (`0.801364`) with `62` exact-K rows and preserved fail-closed
  behavior on `overlap_extreme_4c`, and legacy completes all rows but has the
  weakest mean ARI (`0.726685`) despite `78` exact-K rows.
- Added [[julia-allgo-new-go-ic-tree-summary-plots-20260618]]. The allGO-new
  plot/ranking run scored `31` tree assignments from raw cosine subspace,
  adaptive-diffusion cosine subspace, legacy c2ef components `2-5`, and full
  adaptive diffusion. The output deck contains one UMAP/subspace/tree page per
  tree, plus GO-IC and quality summary plots. Method-separated PDFs/CSVs keep
  the four method families apart, and the previous internal diagnostic name
  `kak` is not used as a reader-facing method label. The display rank is
  quality-tiered before GO-BIC because raw GO-IC alone over-ranks
  near-singleton trees; under that ordering the top rows are full adaptive
  diffusion, legacy c2ef components `2-5`, and adaptive diffusion cosine
  subspace over TF-IDF modes `2-5`.
- Added [[julia-allgo-new-method-version-tree-matrix-20260618]]. The selected
  allGO-new crossed matrix separates gate version from tree geometry, running
  legacy/current gates on raw cosine-subspace and adaptive-diffusion
  cosine-subspace TF-IDF blocks `02-05`, `16-19`, and `53-80`, plus the current
  full adaptive-diffusion tree. The attempted legacy full adaptive-diffusion
  tree was interrupted in the c2ef shortest-path interpolation bottleneck, so
  the completed legacy adaptive examples are the adaptive-diffusion
  cosine-subspace rows.
- Added [[benchmark-plot-backend-fix-20260618]]. The UMAP-triggered plotted
  benchmark abort was traced to Matplotlib loading the macOS GUI backend in a
  command-line/spawned-worker path before UMAP rendering. Benchmark plotting now
  defaults to `MPLBACKEND=Agg` before `pyplot` imports in the full runner,
  shared plot package, and isolated case worker; a plotted isolated
  `method_proof` run completed all `11` cases and merged the PDF report.
- Added [[branch-length-candidate-promotion-audit-20260618]]. The full-suite
  branch-length comparison was converted into an explicit promotion decision:
  do not promote `kl_internal_filter_branch_length_v1` over current `kl` as the
  global default. Branch-length improves `6` matched current rows, loses `7`,
  ties `66`, is branch-only OK on `12`, and current-only OK on `14`; it remains
  the next guarded candidate, but the next test should be a fixed-candidate
  traversal/support audit rather than a global replacement or adaptive policy.
- Added [[branch-length-traversal-audit-20260618]]. The diagnostic records
  current KL and branch-length internal filtering on `16` selected cases,
  producing `32` method rows, `3032` edge-reachable traversal tuple rows,
  `3352` traversal edge-map rows, run logs, and verification logs. The audit
  keeps live clustering traversal separate from the edge-reachable walk that
  continues until child-parent edge tests close.
- Added [[path-conditioned-traversal-audit-20260618]]. The diagnostic extends
  the traversal tuple audit with incoming-parent state, ancestor-chain counts,
  descendant support counts, branch-length path summaries, and truth-label
  tuple diagnostics. The run keeps all traversal decisions fixed, writes
  `3032` path-conditioned tuple rows, records `34` live pass-through rows and
  `14` stacked pass-through rows, and leaves branch-length evaluation as a
  fixed-candidate audit rather than an adaptive routing policy.
- Added [[path-conditioned-hypothesis-audit-20260618]]. The diagnostic joins
  path-conditioned traversal burden to branch/current outcome deltas and recent
  method summaries. It explicitly marks `6/16` selected cases as
  outcome/path status mismatches, keeps `phylo_protein_4taxa` as the clearest
  stacked-pass-through branch loss, separates isolated pass-through losses from
  stacked-chain failures, and records bandwidth-context, internal-filter,
  rescued-legacy, and legacy connections without introducing adaptive routing.
- Added [[path-conditioned-alpha-contract-recheck-20260618]]. The mismatch
  check showed that the earlier `6/16` outcome/path status mismatches came
  from diagnostic alpha defaults (`0.05/0.05`) rather than benchmark-equivalent
  execution. The traversal audit now defaults to the canonical
  `edge_alpha=0.001` and `sibling_alpha=0.01`; the alpha-contract recheck has
  `0/16` status mismatches and `12` exact branch-minus-current delta matches
  against the promotion audit.
- Added [[julia-allgo-new-feature-matrix-quality-20260618]]. The allGO-new
  feature matrix quality run validates `602` genes by `6368` binary GO terms
  with no missing values or zero rows/columns, but records rare-term-heavy GO
  support, `459` duplicate GO-term pattern groups, one duplicate gene-pattern
  group, low marginal GO-term entropy, uneven gene annotation burden, weak
  median pairwise gene similarity, and a distributed SVD spectrum.
- Added [[julia-allgo-new-current-adaptive-diffusion-subspace-tree-20260618]].
  The current-method adaptive diffusion cosine-subspace experiment writes one
  directory per subspace, adds axis-level GO-term loading explanations, and
  ranks `14` completed current KL trees plus one explicit failed-gate subspace.
  The top quality-aware row is `tfidf / adaptive_modes_02_05` with `40`
  clusters, `21/40` coherent clusters, and GO-BIC active per gene
  `1687.966840`; the raw GO-IC winner remains degenerate because of
  singleton-heavy overfragmentation.
- Updated [[julia-allgo-new-current-adaptive-diffusion-subspace-tree-20260618]]
  after moving the experiment under `results/analyses/`: generated large
  combined GO-term loading heatmaps for all `15` subspaces, rebuilt the
  detailed axis-term PDF with a method/value sentence on each page, added a
  combined one-page-per-subspace PDF, and connected CSVs, PDFs, trees, and
  embedding plots through `ARTIFACT_INDEX.md` and
  `connected_results_manifest.json`.
- Added [[current-adaptive-diffusion-subspace-tree-pipeline]] and
  [[allgo-new-interactome-current-adaptive-diffusion-subspace-tree-20260618]].
  The current adaptive-diffusion cosine-subspace runner now derives its
  experiment root and reader-facing prefixes from the input matrix name and
  writes the full connected result structure in one run: rankings,
  specificity-aware rank, method-separated PDFs, all-tree PDFs, manifests, and
  one artifact-complete directory per subspace. The interactome run on
  `feature_matrix_allGO_new_interactome.tsv` completed `7/12` current KL
  subspaces and failed closed for `5/12`; the top specificity-aware row is
  `tfidf / adaptive_modes_06_11`.
- Added [[go-annotation-feature-matrix-pipeline]]. The new wrapper records a
  consistent GO annotation feature-matrix pipeline with matrix-quality,
  canonical current adaptive-diffusion cosine-subspace, optional
  method-matrix audit, and analysis-level audit stages. The 2026-06-19
  inventory over `11` existing allGO result roots separates one matrix-quality
  folder, four candidate-generation folders, one mixed-method GO-IC reader
  report, three canonical current pipeline folders, and two unclassified
  legacy/incomplete folders.
- Updated [[go-annotation-feature-matrix-pipeline]] with the active dataset set:
  `feature_matrix_julia_allGO_new.tsv` and
  `feature_matrix_allGO_new_interactome.tsv`. The interactome Downloads matrix
  was promoted to `data/feature_matrices/`; the Julia Downloads matrix is
  byte-identical to the existing canonical copy. The dataset inventory records
  both active matrices as binary, complete, and free of zero rows/columns, and
  flags the root `feature_matrix_julia_allGO_new (1).tsv` as a non-canonical
  duplicate.
- Added systematic subspace gene-annotation PDFs for both active datasets using
  [[go-annotation-feature-matrix-pipeline]]. The Julia report has `15` pages
  and `112` cluster summaries; the interactome report has `8` pages and `56`
  cluster summaries. The interpretation layer uses local GO feature-matrix
  evidence plus QuickGO term definitions and UniProt reviewed human
  gene/protein labels through `scripts/rest_request.py`; each report cached
  `100` QuickGO records and `80` UniProt lookups with no external lookup
  warnings.
- Rebuilt the systematic subspace gene-annotation outputs with organized
  per-subspace directories and visible plot pages. Each completed subspace now
  has a `subspaces/rank##_weighting_block_name/` directory with cluster roster,
  cluster annotations, gene memberships, source artifacts, a radial tree
  colored by final cluster id, and a full feature-space PCA embedding colored
  by the same cluster assignments. The regenerated PDFs now use one plot page
  followed by one annotation page per completed subspace: the Julia report is
  `29` pages with `2761` complete cluster rows and `8428` gene memberships,
  and the interactome report is `15` pages with `595` complete cluster rows
  and `2373` gene memberships.
- Rebuilt the systematic subspace gene-annotation outputs to include
  failed-gate eigenband directories and explicit diagnostic cluster rosters.
  Accepted subspaces keep `assignment_source=accepted_kl`, while failed-gate
  rows use `assignment_source=diagnostic_linkage_cut` from saved linkage trees
  and are not labeled as final accepted KL output. The Julia report is now
  `30` pages with `15` subspaces, `2828` cluster rows, `9030` gene memberships,
  and invariant `602`-leaf trees. The interactome report is now `24` pages
  with `12` subspaces, `920` cluster rows, `4068` gene memberships, and
  invariant `339`-leaf trees. Each subspace directory now has darker radial
  cluster trees plus full-space, subspace, and tree-distance cluster
  embeddings.
- Added a GO cluster meaningfulness and eigenband-coherence audit. The audit
  uses one-sided hypergeometric GO-feature enrichment with BH correction per
  cluster and `30` size-preserving random partitions per eigenband. Julia has
  many meaningful clusters (`506` strong and `138` moderate), but strict
  eigenband coherence is mixed: only `2/14` accepted KL eigenbands are coherent,
  with `7/14` above-null-mean, `4/14` null-like or weak, and `1/14`
  under-tested. Interactome is stronger at the eigenband level: `3/7` accepted
  KL eigenbands are coherent, `2/7` above-null-mean, and `2/7` null-like or
  weak. Diagnostic linkage-cut eigenbands show internal enrichment but remain
  diagnostic, not accepted final KL output. QuickGO rechecks found `4/27`
  Julia top terms obsolete and `0/21` interactome top terms obsolete.

- Clarified and hardened the cluster-assignment identity contract. Final
  cluster metadata now includes a sorted `leaf_signature` tuple alongside the
  tree-local boundary `root_node`; sample assignment construction rejects
  mismatched signatures and overlapping leaves. Traversal traces now expose
  explicit edge-test tuples `(parent, child)`, sibling-test tuples
  `(parent, left_child, right_child)`, and descendant leaf signatures, making
  edge and sibling decisions interpretable without relying on implicit
  node-key conventions.
- Added p-value diagnostics to live and full-edge traversal traces. Edge debug
  fields report raw and Tree-BH-corrected p-values for the left and right
  child-parent edge tuples, while sibling debug fields report raw/corrected
  sibling p-values, test statistic, degrees of freedom, and method label for
  the parent-keyed sibling tuple. This makes untested sibling rows visible as
  missing p-values rather than silently conflating them with non-significant
  sibling tests.
- Extended selected-family overlap benchmark node decisions with p-value
  context for incoming child-parent edges, outgoing left/right child-parent
  edges, corrected sibling p-values, and sibling method labels. A two-case
  overlap smoke on `overlap_mod_4c_small` and `overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat`
  now writes interpretable edge and sibling p-values to
  `benchmarks/results/selected_family_pvalue_debug_20260619_fixed_edgep/`.
- Checked the baseline overlap fail-closed path on
  `overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat` selected-null data. The default
  `projected_wald_inflation` fit sees `499` positive-weight sibling records
  but `0` strict-null and `0` stopped-edge supported records, so the existing
  calibration-support error is an intended empirical-null contract failure
  rather than a missing p-value or node-key wiring failure. Added the reusable
  `edge_sibling_pvalue_relationship` diagnostic, which joins each parent
  sibling test to its left and right outgoing child-parent edge tests and writes
  parent-level pairs, tidy p-value distributions, a summary table, and an HTML
  report for the overlap benchmark output.
- Added a same-z functional decomposition for the overlap p-value scaling
  problem. The diagnostic recomputes the shared sibling z-vector at every
  binary parent and evaluates fixed-coordinate BH, fixed-global chi-square,
  fixed-block BH, selected projected sibling, and outgoing projected edge
  functionals side by side. On the two-case overlap smoke, outgoing edge
  `-log10` p-values and selected projected sibling `-log10` p-values lie on the
  same scale, while fixed-coordinate sibling BH is typically `8`--`14`
  `-log10` units weaker. This supports the interpretation that the problematic
  scale gap is selected dense-direction/L2 energy versus coordinate-wise BH,
  not a failure of the barycentric child-parent/sibling z-identity.
- Added pass-through audit fields to `GateEvaluator`, live traversal rows, full
  edge-reachable traversal rows, traversal counters, and selected-family node
  decisions. The audit separates disabled pass-through, closed split
  prerequisites, sibling-open normal splits, missing descendant splits,
  support-blocked candidates, and actual pass-through decisions. Also carried
  sorted leaf signatures into sample assignment tables and selected-family node
  decisions so internal nodes created from leaves can be compared by set
  identity rather than only by runtime node id.
- Added explicit sparse and dense sibling evidence channels to the sibling gate
  annotation contract. The active sibling gate p-value now carries a calibration
  label, while sparse fixed-subspace evidence, dense fixed-global evidence, and
  the underlying fixed-coordinate/block/global p-values are reported separately.
  Regenerated the overlap debug smoke under
  `benchmarks/results/selected_family_sparse_dense_debug_20260619/`; the
  relationship summary has median edge `-log10` BH `15.146020`, active sibling
  `0.283232`, sparse sibling `0.391545`, and dense fixed-global `0.126605`.
  The same-z decomposition still shows projected sibling energy on the edge
  scale (`14.860817`), supporting the policy that selected projected energy is
  diagnostic unless selected-tree calibrated or made data-independent.
- Debugged the `overlap_mod_4c_small` selected-null false split in the sparse
  dense smoke. The case is an iid Bernoulli selected-null matrix with one
  truth cluster; the old traversal found six selected Hamming-compact fragments
  after root pass-through. The selected-family guard recorded
  `selected_p_value=0.09` and `guard_would_block=True`, but pass-through support
  only consumed spectral-transport support, so the root still passed through.
  `TreeDecomposition` now combines selected-family pass-through guard support
  with optional spectral support. Rerunning the same seed under
  `benchmarks/results/selected_family_passthrough_support_fix_debug_20260620/`
  returns one cluster with ARI `1.0` and records
  `passthrough_support_blocked` with bottleneck
  `selected_family_passthrough_guard_blocked`.
- Renamed the active method and software identity from KL-TE to Tree-Break
  Selection (TBS). The breaking rename changed the import package to
  `tree_break_selection`, benchmark method ids to the `tbs` family, active
  environment variables to `TBS_*`, the manuscript notation to
  \(\operatorname{TBS}\), \(B_{\mathrm{TBS}}(u)\), and
  \(\mathcal C_{\mathrm{TBS}}\), and the wiki concept page to
  [[tree-break-selection]]. The GitHub repository was renamed to
  `EnesSakalliUniWien/tree-break-selection`, with local `origin` updated to the
  new URL.
- Clarified the TBS method/validation boundary for selected permutations. The
  non-resampling TBS runtime method should inspect the selected tree and fixed
  coordinate evidence directly; selected-root and selected-family permutations
  remain default-off validation diagnostics for understanding selected-tree null
  behavior, not components of the method definition.
- Added a fixed-coordinate FDR reaction panel. The new helper/test coverage
  compares coordinate BH, BY, Holm, Bonferroni, Simes-within-block/BH-over-blocks,
  and block chi-square/BH behavior, showing that BH is a sparse-coordinate
  evidence channel while dense categorical/block movement is better captured by
  block-level quadratic evidence.
- Added benchmark method ids for fixed sibling-gate FDR variants and ran the
  four-case overlap regression subset under default TBS plus coordinate BH, BY,
  Holm, Bonferroni, block chi-square/BH, and block Simes-BH. All fixed-FDR
  variants avoided the default empirical-null support skips, but they over-split
  hard overlap cases; BY was the least aggressive coordinate rule in this
  subset and the only fixed-FDR variant with one exact-K overlap case.
- Repaired the branch-length benchmark feature contract by one-hot encoding
  categorical sequence sites as `Fj_ck` blocks before TBS runs. The compact
  seven-point branch-length sweep now runs for default TBS, the branch-length
  internal filter, and the fixed-FDR variants. Default TBS recovers the correct
  two-way split from branch length `0.20` onward; the branch-length internal
  filter also recovers `0.20`--`1.00` but over-splits at `2.00`; all fixed-FDR
  variants run but over-split strong-signal branch-length cases.
- Normalized linkage-derived TBS branch lengths to relative tree time. The
  constructor now computes
  \(\ell(u,c)=(h(u)-h(c))/h(\mathrm{root})\) when the root merge height is
  positive, so each root-to-leaf path sums to `1` instead of carrying raw
  linkage-distance units. Verified with targeted tree, branch-length utility,
  guarded-rescue, and methodology tests plus `ruff`.
- Ran the post-normalization branch-length comparison smoke under
  `benchmarks/results/branch_length_normalized_comparison_20260623/`. Default
  TBS has `2/7` exact two-split rows and one calibration-support skip in this
  seed; `tbs_internal_filter_branch_length_v1` has `2/7` exact two-split rows
  without skips; IQ-TREE and single-linkage TBS each have `4/7` exact two-split
  rows; fixed-coordinate and fixed-block FDR variants complete but over-split
  all seven rows. K-known K-means and spectral baselines recover `6/7` rows
  when supplied the true `K=2`, so they remain supervised-oracle baselines
  rather than comparable adaptive cluster-count methods.
- Ran the normalized-branch cross-regime smoke requested after the sequence
  benchmark under
  `benchmarks/results/normalized_branch_cross_regime_20260623/`. The panel
  covers non-sequence categorical, binary Bernoulli, continuous Gaussian plus
  low-rank, overlap selected-root, and SBM graph cases. Default TBS and the
  branch-length internal candidate both solve the binary rows; the
  branch-length candidate improves one categorical row but is not uniformly
  better; fixed-coordinate/block FDR variants complete but over-split binary,
  categorical, and overlap rows; continuous rows fail closed under the active
  continuous-covariance contract; and graph rows favor default/neighbor-joining
  tree geometry over branch-length internal filtering. K-known K-means and
  spectral baselines solve binary/categorical rows but remain weak on
  continuous low-rank, overlap, and SBM rows.

### 2026-06-23

- Added a continuous-data TBS execution path using Mahalanobis-time tree
  distances and continuous covariance fallback storage. Continuous generators now
  precompute `mahalanobis_time` distances
  \((x_a-x_b)^T\widehat\Sigma^{-1}(x_a-x_b)/d\); direct TBS dispatch can compute
  the same metric from a continuous `FeatureSpace`; fixed-subspace sibling
  gates now pass parent node continuous covariance blocks; and high-dimensional
  continuous nodes store diagonal empirical-Gaussian variance vectors when full
  dense covariance would exceed the active memory contract. Focused checks show
  the previous continuous covariance/memory skips are removed, while moderate
  continuous Gaussian and low-rank cases still under-split or fail default
  empirical-null support, so continuous calibration remains a method question.
- Updated projected-Wald contrast covariance to use normalized branch time as a
  conservative variance multiplier. Child-parent edge tests now use
  \((1/n_c-1/n_u)(1+t_{u,c}/\bar t)\), sibling tests use
  \((1/n_L+1/n_R)(1+(t_{u,L}+t_{u,R})/(2\bar t))\), and missing or zero branch
  time preserves the previous sampling-only variance. The method notes and wiki
  formulas were updated to distinguish this runtime branch-time relaxation from
  a full Brownian phylogenetic covariance model.
- Added `continuous-tree-geometry-rethink-20260623` after rerunning compact
  family-level and oracle diagnostics. The note records that the pre-patch
  Gaussian continuous generator used pooled `mahalanobis_time`, that
  standardized Euclidean geometry repairs the consolidated continuous
  mean-shift case, and that low-rank, overlap, and SBM failures are separate
  tree-recoverability or selected-gate problems rather than the same continuous
  geometry bug.
- Changed Gaussian location-style continuous generators to precompute
  `standardized_euclidean` tree distances while retaining `mahalanobis_time`
  for low-rank, spiked covariance, and phylogenetic Brownian diagnostic
  continuous generators. The post-patch compact run solves
  `dim_consolidated_4c_24f_continuous` for default TBS and fixed-FDR variants
  with ARI `1.0`. The added eigen/size diagnostic shows the old failure is
  strongly tied to pooled total-covariance eigenvectors: `0.998799` of the
  between-cluster signal lies in the top `K-1` total-covariance eigenvectors,
  the center-subspace cosine-squared is `0.998783`, Mahalanobis weighting
  compresses between energy to `0.086563` of raw, and the old root split is
  `1/159` instead of the repaired `40/120`.
- Ran the canonical full benchmark after the continuous-geometry change under
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260623_110027Z_full_big/`. The run completed `121`
  cases and `9` methods (`1089` rows), with `tbs` producing `98` ok rows and
  `23` skips. Mean ARI over ok rows ranked `kmeans` first (`0.863921`) and
  default `tbs` fifth (`0.763189`). The large run confirms the
  `dim_consolidated_4c_24f_continuous` repair but also shows several
  continuous Gaussian/default-gate regressions and persistent low-rank,
  selected-root, SBM, and method-proof boundaries, so standardized Euclidean is
  a targeted tree-geometry repair rather than a full continuous calibration
  solution.
- Debugged where the continuous Gaussian full-run edges changed. The immediate
  closure mechanism is the active branch-time variance multiplier in the
  projected-Wald contrast covariance, not standardized Euclidean alone.
  `gauss_clear_medium_continuous` and `gauss_moderate_3c_continuous` both
  reopen to the expected `K=4` and `K=3` in a throwaway run that disables only
  tree-time variance inflation; their active root sibling multipliers are
  large (`6.13x`, `4.74x`), while the repaired
  `dim_consolidated_4c_24f_continuous` root multiplier is only `1.12x`.
- Added an inner-node Gaussian branch-time debug source. The audit shows that
  `gauss_clear_medium_continuous` and `gauss_moderate_3c_continuous` have the
  correct standardized pure-split topology, but long child edges are treated as
  null variance by the active child-parent and sibling Wald gates. Removing only
  the time multiplier changes ARI from `0.0` to `1.0` in both cases, whereas
  fixed-coordinate sibling gating alone is insufficient because child-parent
  prerequisites still close on the long pure edges.
- Extended the Gaussian inner-node debug with eigen-alignment evidence. The
  parent covariance eigenvectors align with the tested child contrast, the
  between-child term explains a large share of parent covariance trace, and
  whitening by that same parent covariance flattens the descendant eigenvalues
  so the MP signal count is `0`. The no-time Wald norm then saturates near the
  parent node size, identifying total-parent-covariance whitening as a separate
  continuous Gaussian calibration problem from branch-time variance inflation.
- Tested within-child covariance replays for the continuous Gaussian failures.
  Node-level statistics confirm that parent-total covariance suppresses the
  Gaussian split direction, but unguarded within covariance over-splits both
  signal and null cases. A guarded full within-child covariance replay, applied
  only when immediate children have enough mass, recovers the two focused
  Gaussian signal cases with branch time still active, keeps the Gaussian null
  closed, and preserves the solved `dim_consolidated_4c_24f_continuous` case
  under both fixed-coordinate BH and the default empirical-null sibling layer.
- Checked whether the guarded within-child covariance idea transfers to
  Bernoulli and categorical sibling tests. The discrete replay keeps branch
  time active and compares current pooled null covariance against Jeffreys
  within-child and `25%` pooled-guard variants. Unlike Gaussian parent-total
  empirical covariance, pooled Bernoulli/multinomial covariance is the ordinary
  two-sample null MLE. The representative selected-node panel shows discrete
  within-child covariance opens many more selected nulls: Bernoulli strict-null
  nodes rise from `4/722` current opens to `18/722`, categorical strict-null
  nodes rise from `12/994` to `72/994`, and a synthetic categorical null rises
  from `0/119` to `14/119` (`7/119` with the `25%` pooled guard). The all-suite
  root replay confirms most binary/categorical roots are already open under
  current pooled covariance, while within covariance closes tiny-child
  categorical Dirichlet-multinomial roots. The discrete covariance fix should
  therefore not be ported directly without a separate boundary/selected-null
  calibration.
- Implemented the opt-in guarded continuous covariance candidate. The code
  adds `continuous_covariance_policy=guarded_within_child` with an `8`-leaf
  child-mass guard, keeps discrete pooled null covariance unchanged, routes the
  policy through edge, sibling, fixed-coordinate evidence, benchmark dispatch,
  and annotation metadata, and registers
  `tbs_continuous_guarded_within_covariance` without aliases. Focused validation
  repairs the two continuous Gaussian under-splits, preserves the Gaussian null
  and `dim_consolidated_4c_24f_continuous`, and the current dispatch runs
  non-continuous inputs through default TBS sibling gating rather than skipping
  them.
- Ran the full 121-case benchmark for `tbs` versus
  `tbs_continuous_guarded_within_covariance` with plots and relationship
  analysis disabled. Default `tbs` produced `98` ok rows and `23` skips; the
  integrated guarded candidate produced `100` ok rows and `21` skips. Among
  `98` paired ok rows, guarded covariance had four continuous Gaussian/outlier
  ARI improvements, `94` ties, and no regressions; binary, categorical,
  graph-adjacency, median-binary, and quantile-one-hot paired rows were exact
  ties. The candidate still under-splits dimensional, low-rank, and above-BBP
  continuous method-proof cases.
- Consolidated the GO annotation feature-matrix run path so
  `scripts/analysis/run_go_annotation_feature_matrix_pipeline.py` is the
  canonical entry point for publishable outputs. The wrapper now plans radial
  tree roster export, systematic subspace annotation PDFs, cluster
  meaningfulness audits, recurring top-annotation tables, input-matrix copying,
  and `RUN_SUMMARY.md`; direct helper scripts are documented as repair/debug
  tools rather than the ordinary upload path.
- Repaired the memory validation contract after introducing mex. Missing wiki
  source citations were normalized to existing local evidence directories so
  `make wiki-lint` remains strict and enforceable. The `.mex/` scaffold is now
  documented as a compatibility bridge into the wiki rather than a second memory
  source, durable logging remains in `wiki/log.md`, and
  `tests/wiki/test_memory_contract.py` verifies wiki lint, mex routing, mex
  placeholder removal, and lookup of core method pages.
- Downloaded the public Scanpy human pancreas AnnData object and added
  `scripts/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark.py` for a reproducible classical
  Scanpy PCA-neighbor workflow plus clustering benchmark. Outputs live in
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark_20260623/`;
  [[pancreas-scrna-clustering-benchmark-20260623]] records that the original
  adaptive 2D edge projection collapses TBS at the root, while the corrected
  `spectral_minimum_dimension = 20` edge setting opens traversal and gives
  `76` clusters with `ARI 0.2710` and `NMI 0.6263`.
- Repaired the production edge-gate math contract after the pancreas failure.
  Branch lengths are now topology/support diagnostics by default and only enter
  child-parent Wald variance through the explicit
  `edge_branch_length_variance_policy="normalized_branch_length"` setting.
  Fixed-coordinate sibling gates now raise the edge-gate projection floor to
  the fixed feature-space dimension, and gate-reuse metadata records the branch
  time policy. Focused tests cover default no-time behavior, normalized
  branch-time opt-in, projection-floor compatibility, and reuse metadata.
- Reran the pancreas benchmark with topology-only TBS, normalized branch-time
  TBS, and adaptive diffusion topology TBS at sibling alpha `0.01` and edge
  alpha `0.001`. The benchmark now reports split/merge diagnostics instead of
  relying on ARI alone. TBS is purity-heavy but fragmentation-heavy: topology
  only gives `102` clusters, purity `0.9368`, dominant-cluster recall `0.2852`,
  and split error `0.7148`; normalized branch time gives `69` clusters, purity
  `0.9076`, recall `0.3392`, and split error `0.6608`; adaptive diffusion gives
  `72` clusters, purity `0.9448`, recall `0.3496`, and split error `0.6504`.
  [[edge-gate-distance-time-contract-20260623]] records the math contract and
  [[pancreas-scrna-clustering-benchmark-20260623]] records the updated outputs.
- Added a fixed-topology branch-time transform scan to the pancreas benchmark.
  The scan rescales edge Wald statistics, reapplies Tree-BH, reruns traversal,
  and scores split/merge behavior as supervised failure analysis. On the
  standardized-PCA topology, `linear_scale_2` improves dominant-cluster recall
  to `0.4684` with `55` clusters but lowers purity to `0.9044`; stronger
  scaling reaches `33` clusters but collapses purity to `0.6696`. On adaptive
  diffusion topology, `quadratic_scale_1` gives V-measure `0.6481` with `37`
  clusters, purity `0.9252`, and recall `0.3876`. The result shows branch-time
  transforms are a split/merge dial, not yet an unsupervised production fix.
- Installed local R plotting dependencies (`BiocManager`, `ggtree`, `treeio`,
  `ape`, and an updated local `ggplot2`) and added
  `scripts/plot_pancreas_tbs_radial_trees_ggtree.R`. The script converts the
  three TBS edge tables from the pancreas benchmark into `ape::phylo` objects
  and renders whole-tree circular `ggtree` plots. Each plot contains `2,500`
  tips, `2,499` internal nodes, and `4,998` edges, with PNG/PDF paths recorded
  in `raw/assets/benchmark-results/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark_20260623/tbs_radial_tree_ggtree_outputs.csv`.
- Corrected the pancreas TBS UMAP-plus-tree panel after review showed the left
  UMAP side was ambiguous with the earlier readable-large-cluster plot. The
  regenerated
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark_20260623/tbs_umap_cluster_radial_tree_combo_all_clusters_ggtree.png`
  colors every final TBS cluster on the UMAP and matching terminal tree
  subtrees, labels only clusters with at least `50` cells, and leaves shared
  tree ancestors grey. The legacy combo filename is overwritten as an alias to
  the same all-cluster figure.
- Rescaled the same pancreas TBS UMAP-plus-tree panel for readability. The new
  primary artifact
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark_20260623/tbs_umap_cluster_radial_tree_combo_scaled_umap_ggtree.png`
  uses tight global UMAP limits, larger points, larger cluster labels, no UMAP
  axis chrome, and a balanced UMAP/tree width allocation. The all-cluster and
  legacy combo paths are overwritten as aliases to this scaled rendering.
- Mapped redundant and legacy code surfaces in
  [[redundant-and-legacy-code-map-20260623]]. The audit identifies the
  c2ef9a69 package as an intentional non-production comparator snapshot that is
  still live through benchmark registries, and ranks cleanup targets in shared
  gate predicates, validation-report scaffolding, cloud sharding helpers,
  diagnostic-panel utilities, and small lint-level unused code.
- Repaired the pancreas gate-dimension path so both production gates are
  projected/adaptive instead of using the rejected fixed-coordinate full-rank
  edge workaround. The edge and sibling projected-Wald kernels now accept
  `adaptive_projection_dimension_energy_fraction`; the benchmark uses `0.9`.
  The MP/floor dimension remains `2`, while local contrasts choose the shortest
  PCA prefix carrying 90% projected energy. The rerun gives adaptive-diffusion
  TBS `43` clusters, purity `0.9288`, recall `0.4840`, split error `0.5160`,
  and V-measure `0.6620`; topology-only TBS gives `45` clusters and V-measure
  `0.6020`; the raw-linkage branch-time diagnostic collapses to `9` clusters
  and V-measure `0.3124`. The updated side-by-side UMAP/full-tree plot is
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark_20260623/tbs_umap_cluster_radial_tree_combo_scaled_umap_ggtree.png`.
- Added and benchmarked native fixed-topology NNLS branch-length optimization
  for continuous pancreas PCA distances. The standardized-PCA NNLS branch-time
  row completes with `45` clusters, purity `0.7928`, dominant-cluster recall
  `0.5800`, and V-measure `0.6020`; the adaptive-diffusion NNLS branch-time row
  completes with `43` clusters, purity `0.9288`, recall `0.4840`, and
  V-measure `0.6620`. Both avoid the raw linkage branch-time collapse to `9`
  clusters. The NNLS fits use `50,000` sampled leaf pairs and record residual
  RMSE about `0.30` in
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark_20260623/tbs_tree_branch_length_summary.csv`.
  The adaptive NNLS run also required a continuous-covariance Cholesky repair
  after branch-time scaling. Regenerated six-row `ggtree` UMAP/tree plots use a
  display-only sqrt-capped branch-length transform and audit `226/226` colored
  clusters as exact clades.
- Corrected the branch-time linkage-tree contract so raw linkage ultrametric
  heights cannot be used for normalized branch-time variance unless the run
  explicitly opts into `allow_linkage_ultrametric_branch_time=True` as a
  diagnostic/negative-control path. The pancreas benchmark now labels the real
  branch-time rows as recomputed-NNLS and the old raw-height rows as
  raw-linkage diagnostics. The rerun preserves the result pattern:
  standardized recomputed-NNLS branch time gives `45` clusters and V-measure
  `0.6020`, adaptive-diffusion recomputed-NNLS gives `43` clusters and
  V-measure `0.6620`, while the standardized raw-linkage diagnostic still
  collapses to `9` clusters and V-measure `0.3124`.
- Corrected the pancreas UMAP rendering contract after review found that the
  standalone readable UMAP greyed out small clusters, which made real assigned
  clusters look unassigned. `scripts/plot_pancreas_tbs_readable_umap_clusters.py`
  now colors every final TBS cluster and thresholds only labels, while
  `scripts/plot_pancreas_all_method_umap_clusters.py` writes
  `all_methods_umap_clusters_all_colored.png` for curated labels, all six TBS
  rows, and the classical baselines. The six-row `ggtree` UMAP/tree combo was
  regenerated with larger UMAP points, larger labels, thicker readable branch
  strokes, and the same exact-clade audit result: `226/226` colored TBS
  clusters are exact clades.
- Compared adaptive-diffusion TBS internal nodes with pancreas progenitor-style
  lineage expectations. `scripts/analyze_pancreas_tbs_inner_nodes.py` now writes
  `tbs_adaptive_inner_node_lineage_summary.csv`,
  `tbs_adaptive_inner_node_progenitor_review.csv`, and
  `tbs_adaptive_inner_node_progenitor_comparison.png`. Among internal nodes
  with at least `50` leaves, the review finds `61` mature cell-type nodes, `21`
  local geometry nodes, `17` broad mixed-pancreas nodes, and `4` endocrine
  mixed descendant nodes. The main shared ancestor `N4963` contains `947`
  descendants (`beta:463`, `alpha:418`, `delta:34`, `gamma:24`), but `NEUROG3`
  is zero and marker means are dominated by mature endocrine hormones, so the
  correct interpretation is lineage-coherent hierarchy ancestor rather than
  validated progenitor.
- Extended the pancreas inner-node analysis to every terminal final-cluster
  root. All `43` adaptive TBS final clusters have exact internal clade roots.
  Terminal root groupings are `33` local geometry nodes, `9` mature cell-type
  nodes, and `1` endocrine mixed descendant node. The only terminal root with an
  ancestor-like mixed endocrine composition is cluster `36`, node `N4881`
  (`delta:85`, `gamma:31`, `epsilon:3`, `NEUROG3 = 0.0`). Internal mixed nodes
  inside final cluster subtrees are limited to `N4789` and `N4881` in cluster
  `36`, plus `N4921` inside beta-dominant cluster `42`; none supports a true
  progenitor call.
- Checked direct junction nodes where exactly two or three final adaptive TBS
  clusters meet. There are `10` direct two/three-cluster junctions and `5`
  compositionally mixed ones: `N4957` (`C14,C15,C16`, `43` cells, mostly
  alpha), `N4964` (`C7,C8`, `28` beta-dominant endocrine cells), `N4922`
  (`C15,C16`, `20` alpha/beta/gamma cells plus one ductal), `N4965`
  (`C30,C31`, `20` stromal/ductal cells), and `N4857` (`C38,C39`, `19`
  gamma/alpha/beta cells). All have `NEUROG3 = 0.0`; the UMAP highlight shows
  localized contact neighborhoods rather than broad bridges, so these remain
  local mature-state/boundary contacts rather than progenitor-supported nodes.
- Added an exact monophyletic-subtree meeting pass to
  `scripts/analyze_pancreas_tbs_inner_nodes.py`. It keeps only nodes whose
  immediate children are exact unions of complete final adaptive TBS clusters,
  producing `42` meetings for the `43` terminal clusters. Most are ladder-like
  broad context splits. The focused mixed set is `N4963`, `N4917`, `N4957`,
  `N4964`, `N4922`, `N4965`, and `N4857`. `N4963` is the only large balanced
  mixed meeting (`C38,C39,C40,C41` versus `C42`, `947` cells, `99.3%`
  endocrine), but `NEUROG3 = 0.0`, so the call remains endocrine hierarchy
  ancestor over mature states rather than validated progenitor. New outputs are
  `tbs_adaptive_monophyletic_subtree_meeting_review.csv`,
  `tbs_adaptive_monophyletic_subtree_meeting_child_summary.csv`, and
  `tbs_adaptive_monophyletic_subtree_meeting_mixed_umap.png`.
- Added `scripts/compare_pancreas_tbs_to_progenitor_signatures.py` to compare
  focused monophyletic-subtree meetings, child branches, TBS clusters, and
  celltype states against pancreas progenitor and mature-state signatures. The
  full AnnData has only `5/14,693` `NEUROG3+` cells, and the `2,500`-cell TBS
  benchmark subset has `0/2,500`, so no TBS node can be a sampled `NEUROG3+`
  endocrine progenitor population. `N4963` has `NEUROG3 = 0.0`, `0%`
  `NEUROG3+`, endocrine-progenitor-core score `-0.049`, and low endocrine
  commitment score `-0.314`, supporting the mature endocrine hierarchy-ancestor
  interpretation. The small junctions `N4957`, `N4964`, and `N4922` score high
  for `PAX4`/endocrine-commitment and mature hormone programs but still lack
  `NEUROG3`, so they are endocrine-committed or mature-state neighborhoods, not
  progenitor-supported states. New outputs include
  `pancreas_progenitor_signature_dataset_summary.csv`,
  `pancreas_full_neurog3_positive_cells.csv`,
  `tbs_adaptive_monophyletic_meeting_progenitor_signature_comparison.csv`,
  `pancreas_benchmark_celltype_progenitor_signature_scores.csv`,
  `tbs_adaptive_cluster_progenitor_signature_scores.csv`,
  `pancreas_progenitor_signature_comparison.png`, and
  `pancreas_progenitor_signature_umap.png`.
- Added [[pancreas-progenitor-dataset-selection-20260624]] after the
  progenitor-signature analysis showed that the current adult pancreas subset
  has `0/2,500` `NEUROG3+` cells. The decision record ranks Goncalves et al.
  human fetal pancreas UCSC processed data as the immediate rerun target,
  Olaniru et al. `GSE197064` as the broader fetal time-course benchmark, and
  Krentz et al. `GSE120522` as a NEUROG3-positive-control benchmark.
- Added `scripts/goncalves_pancreas_progenitor_benchmark.py` for the selected
  Goncalves fetal pancreas dataset and parameterized the all-method UMAP,
  radial-tree, and UMAP-plus-tree plotting scripts with `--output-dir`. The
  benchmark preserves counts, recomputes a standard Scanpy workflow, reuses the
  current TBS/classical method set, and writes the same split/merge, branch
  length, UMAP, and tree diagnostics. The local sandbox cannot resolve
  `cells.ucsc.edu`, so the run currently stops at a clean download blocker
  instructing where to place `exprMatrix.tsv.gz` and `meta.tsv` for
  `--skip-download`; [[goncalves-pancreas-progenitor-benchmark-prep-20260624]]
  records the validation checks.
- Reran the Goncalves fetal pancreas benchmark after network access was enabled.
  The UCSC `exprMatrix.tsv.gz` and `meta.tsv` were downloaded to
  `raw/inbox/goncalves_human_pancreas_dev/fetal-pancreas/`, and the benchmark
  used all `1,465` cells with `8` `population` labels. The matrix contains
  negative non-integer values, so the workflow treats it as processed/scaled
  expression rather than raw counts. Louvain leads the current table
  (`12` clusters, V-measure `0.4431`, ARI `0.3264`), Leiden is close
  (`11` clusters, V-measure `0.4394`), adaptive-diffusion TBS gives
  `24` clusters with V-measure `0.4100`, and standardized branch-time TBS
  collapses to one cluster. The generated all-method UMAP and TBS
  UMAP-plus-full-radial-tree plots live under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/goncalves_fetal_pancreas_progenitor_benchmark_20260624/`,
  and the tree highlighting audit reports `114/114` colored TBS clusters as
  exact clades.
- Added `scripts/analyze_goncalves_tbs_progenitors.py` for marker/signature
  analysis of the Goncalves fetal pancreas benchmark. The script maps marker
  symbols to Ensembl IDs, scores fetal trunk, tip, proliferating,
  endocrine-progenitor, mesenchyme, neuronal, and blood signatures, and writes
  population, TBS-cluster, inner-node, and monophyletic-meeting tables plus
  UMAP/heatmap/meeting plots. The analysis maps `37/39` markers, finds pure
  tip cluster `C6`, pure proliferating cluster `C1`, compact endocrine cluster
  `C12`, large mixed progenitor-rich cluster `C22`, within-cluster progenitor
  nodes such as `N2851`, `N2903`, and `N2758`, and exact monophyletic
  proliferating meetings `N2876` and `N2910`; [[goncalves-tbs-progenitor-analysis-20260624]]
  records the result.
- Added `scripts/plot_goncalves_tbs_progenitor_trees_ggtree.R` and rendered
  progenitor-specific whole radial trees for the adaptive-diffusion TBS
  Goncalves run. Outputs include dominant fetal population,
  trunk/tip/proliferating fraction, interpreted progenitor state, and a combined
  panel under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/goncalves_fetal_pancreas_progenitor_benchmark_20260624/`.
  The tree plots label `N2851`, `N2903`, `N2758`, `N2876`, `N2910`, `N2907`,
  and `N2872` on the full `1,465`-tip tree.
- Consolidated the Goncalves progenitor UMAP/tree rendering into the same
  `scripts/plot_goncalves_tbs_progenitor_trees_ggtree.R` plotting line. Running
  `Rscript scripts/plot_goncalves_tbs_progenitor_trees_ggtree.R --pdf-width=30
  --pdf-height=42 --page-width=30 --page-height=16 --png-dpi=180` now writes
  `goncalves_tbs_progenitor_umap_tree_panel_wide_ggtree.pdf`, a wider vector
  row-wise UMAP/tree panel with one UMAP/tree pair per row, plus
  `goncalves_tbs_progenitor_umap_tree_pages_ggtree.pdf`, a multi-page vector
  PDF with one UMAP/tree pair per page. The PNG previews are now screen-sized
  instead of poster-sized, dropping the page preview from `16200 x 8400` pixels
  to `5400 x 2880`; the UMAP render uses larger cell points, centered UMAP
  titles, and a slightly wider UMAP column. The script records dimensions and
  PNG DPI in `goncalves_tbs_progenitor_tree_outputs.csv`.
- Added [[scrna-plot-pipeline-audit-20260624]] after reviewing the adult
  pancreas and Goncalves plot generators and outputs. The audit records that
  TBS cluster-to-tree assignment is exact in the highlighting audits
  (`226/226` adult and `114/114` Goncalves), while the plot surface is
  ambiguous because byte-identical alias images and overlapping UMAP/tree
  review views are listed as peer artifacts. It recommends one plot manifest,
  canonical all-method and TBS UMAP/tree outputs, explicit alias metadata, and
  a single documented plotting order.
- Added `scripts/run_scrna_plot_pipeline.py` as the scRNA plotting
  orchestration and manifest layer. The script defines the adult pancreas and
  Goncalves plot-generator order, accepts `--run-generators` for rerendering,
  and writes `plot_manifest.csv`/`.json` with canonical, derivative, alias, and
  orphaned previous-run classifications. Strict manifest generation passed for
  both current output folders: the adult manifest records `112` plot artifacts
  with `46` orphaned previous-run files, while the Goncalves manifest records
  `58` plot artifacts with no orphaned status. Added `--output-dir` to the
  hard-coded readable TBS UMAP, cluster radial tree, and Goncalves progenitor
  analyzer entry points so the wrapper can call them consistently; the
  Goncalves analyzer now reuses cached marker mapping unless refresh is
  requested.
- Regenerated the adult pancreas and Goncalves scRNA plot surfaces through
  `scripts/run_scrna_plot_pipeline.py --run-generators --strict`, using
  `/Users/berksakalli/miniconda3/bin/python` and the local R runtime at
  `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/bin/Rscript`.
  The adult rerender regenerated the all-method UMAP, readable TBS UMAP,
  edge-state radial trees, cluster radial trees, UMAP/tree combo aliases, and
  plot manifest; the exact-clade audits report `226/226` UMAP/tree clusters and
  `226/226` cluster-radial-tree clusters. The Goncalves rerender regenerated
  the all-method UMAP, TBS radial trees, UMAP/tree combo aliases, progenitor
  signature plots, progenitor UMAP/tree pages, and plot manifest; its UMAP/tree
  audit reports `114/114` exact clades. The adult manifest remains
  `112` plots with `46` orphaned previous-run files, and the Goncalves manifest
  remains `58` present plots with no orphaned status.
- Added `scripts/plot_goncalves_clustering_progenitor_relation.py` and wired it
  into the Goncalves scRNA plot manifest as a canonical relation overview. The
  new plot stacks the adaptive-diffusion TBS final-cluster UMAP/tree row above
  the Goncalves progenitor UMAP/tree panel so clustering and progenitor
  interpretation can be read in one view. It writes
  `goncalves_tbs_clustering_progenitor_relation_overview.png` and `.pdf`; the
  Goncalves plot manifest now records `60` present plot artifacts.
- Replaced the Goncalves relation overview screenshot-composite with direct
  ggtree outputs from `scripts/plot_goncalves_tbs_progenitor_trees_ggtree.R`.
  The obsolete `scripts/plot_goncalves_clustering_progenitor_relation.py` helper
  and its `goncalves_tbs_clustering_progenitor_relation_overview.*` outputs were
  removed. New canonical relation artifacts are
  `goncalves_tbs_relation_umap_grid_ggtree.*`,
  `goncalves_tbs_relation_tree_grid_ggtree.*`, and
  `goncalves_tbs_relation_umap_tree_pages_ggtree.pdf`; the Goncalves manifest
  now records `66` present plot artifacts.
- Added `scripts/audit_scrna_branch_length_effects.py` and
  [[scrna-branch-length-effect-audit-20260624]] after rerunning the adult
  pancreas and Goncalves scRNA analyses. The audit joins method metrics,
  branch-length summaries, assignment similarities, and branch-time sensitivity
  scans. It records that branch lengths do not place cells on the tree:
  topology is inferred first from standardized-PCA or adaptive-diffusion
  distance matrices, then branch lengths are stored or refit. Adaptive-diffusion
  TBS is stable across branch-time variants (`43` adult clusters for topology
  and NNLS, `41` for raw-linkage; `24` Goncalves clusters for all three
  variants), while standardized-PCA branch-time is unstable (`45` to `9` adult
  clusters under raw-linkage, and `40` to `1` Goncalves clusters under both
  branch-time rows). The refreshed Goncalves relation PDF has `4` pages and the
  current plot manifest records `66` present artifacts.
- Added `scripts/audit_scrna_distributional_action.py` and
  [[scrna-distributional-action-audit-20260624]] after checking whether leaf
  count alone captures internal-node mass. The audit reconstructs node
  barycenters from saved PCA leaves and TBS edge tables, then writes
  `subtree_distributional_action = child_leaf_count *
  mean_standardized_PCA_delta^2` for each edge. Adult and Goncalves
  adaptive-diffusion TBS both have `0/10` overlap between top action edges and
  top descendant-mass edges; Goncalves action-vs-leaf-count rank correlation is
  `-0.0334`, showing that leaf count and branch length must remain separate
  from distributional movement when interpreting internal nodes.
- Added a `generated_at` timestamp to scRNA plot-manifest JSON summaries and
  regenerated strict adult pancreas and Goncalves plot manifests without
  rerunning plot generators. Current strict manifests record adult pancreas
  `120` plot rows (`66` present, `54` orphaned previous-run files) and
  Goncalves `74` plot rows (`66` present, `8` orphaned q50 action/split-action
  diagnostics). Verified with py-compile, `ruff check`, focused pipeline
  pytest, strict manifest generation, and a manifest timestamp/canonical/alias
  checker.
- Added `Generated at:` timestamps to the generated scRNA branch-length and
  distributional-action audit markdown reports, then reran both audit scripts.
  The refreshed reports record timestamps
  `2026-06-24T19:26:13+02:00` and `2026-06-24T19:26:17+02:00`, respectively.
  Verified with py-compile, `ruff check`, focused pipeline/statistics pytest,
  and direct artifact timestamp checks.
- Promoted distributional action into a tested statistics helper. Added
  `tree_break_selection/hierarchy_analysis/statistics/distributional_action.py`
  with `edge_distributional_action` and `binary_split_distributional_action`,
  wired the scRNA audit script through the helper, and added
  `tests/statistics/47_test_distributional_action_contract.py`. The tests lock
  the binary split variance identity and verify that edge action changes with
  child-parent distributional movement while remaining independent of branch
  length.
- Extended the distributional-action helper with mass-bearing summary objects.
  Edge summaries now expose `parent_mass`, `child_mass`, and
  `child_parent_mass_fraction`; binary split summaries expose `left_mass`,
  `right_mass`, `parent_mass`, and both child-parent mass fractions. The scRNA
  audit script now uses the tested summary path for `child_parent_fraction` and
  action values.
- Integrated distributional action into the scRNA benchmark exporter and reran
  the adult pancreas and Goncalves benchmarks. Current canonical TBS
  `*_tree_edges.csv` files now include `distributional_action_parent_mass`,
  `distributional_action_child_mass`,
  `distributional_action_child_parent_mass_fraction`,
  `distributional_action_squared_displacement`, `distributional_action`, and
  `distributional_action_per_branch_length`. Added
  `tests/pipeline/66_test_scrna_benchmark_distributional_action.py` so the
  benchmark-export path verifies these columns on a generated tree edge table.
- Added an off-by-default distributional-action edge-filter toggle to the TBS
  benchmark runner and registered activated q50 topology rows for the adult
  pancreas and Goncalves scRNA benchmarks. This first edge-local toggle is now
  a superseded negative control. Rerunning both benchmarks showed that closing
  child edges independently is destructive: adult adaptive-diffusion TBS drops
  from `43` clusters, `ARI = 0.412704`, `NMI = 0.662011` to `26` clusters,
  `ARI = 0.161019`, `NMI = 0.463299`; Goncalves adaptive-diffusion TBS
  collapses from `24` clusters, `ARI = 0.205837`, `NMI = 0.409991` to one
  cluster with zero ARI/NMI. The recursive distributional-action audit now
  includes those superseded q50 rows and records `63,408` edge diagnostics.
- Added [[barycentric-split-action-formula-20260624]] after revisiting the
  barycentric internal-node view. The corrected formula is the parent split
  action \(A(p)=\sum_i m_i\lVert\mu_i-\mu_p\rVert^2\), with binary form
  \(A(p)=m_Lm_R(m_L+m_R)^{-1}\lVert\mu_L-\mu_R\rVert^2\). New tests verify
  mass-tied child edge shares, the `1:99` counterexample where a tiny large-child
  edge contribution still belongs to a large split, and recursive topology-level
  inertia decomposition across internal nodes.
- Rewrote the distributional-action activation path from edge-local filtering
  to parent split-action filtering. The runner and dispatch parameters are now
  `distributional_action_split_filter_policy` and
  `distributional_action_split_filter_quantile`; the activated benchmark rows
  are labeled split-action q50. The annotator writes child edge contributions
  plus `Distributional_Split_Action_*` columns and closes or keeps whole parent
  splits rather than individual children.
- Reran the full adult pancreas and Goncalves fetal pancreas scRNA benchmarks
  after the parent split-action rewrite, then reran
  `scripts/audit_scrna_distributional_action.py`. The corrected q50 filter is
  mathematically tied to parent splits, but it is not better as a benchmark
  method: adult standardized-PCA TBS drops from `45` clusters and
  `V = 0.602029` to `9` clusters and `V = 0.312426`; adult adaptive-diffusion
  TBS drops from `43` clusters and `V = 0.662011` to `25` clusters and
  `V = 0.462233`; Goncalves standardized-PCA and adaptive-diffusion split-action
  q50 both collapse to one cluster with zero V-measure. The trace reason is
  that q50 filters the small parent split nodes used by the unfiltered
  traversal: `2/3` adult standardized-PCA split nodes, `5/6` adult adaptive
  split nodes, and all `3/3` split nodes in both Goncalves geometries.
- Corrected the distributional-action integration after auditing the actual
  TBS gate formula and traversal. Non-`none` split-action filters now raise as
  diagnostic-only until calibrated against the projected-Wald edge/sibling gate
  system, the scRNA benchmark registry no longer registers `split-action q50`
  rows, and the audit script no longer reads stale q50 files. Focused tests
  passed (`42` tests), the continuous smoke rerun completed with guarded
  within-child covariance at `9/9` ok and mean `ARI = 0.769202`, and the full
  adult pancreas plus Goncalves scRNA benchmarks were rerun with `11` active
  rows each and no action/split filter method labels. The refreshed
  distributional-action audit records `47,556` canonical edge diagnostics, all
  with `split_filter_policy = none` and `split_filter_filtered_count = 0`.
- Updated and regenerated the MNIST Plotly report so the visible-label 3D UMAP
  pages use centered digit text on larger marker hit targets while preserving
  `Number:` hover labels. The refreshed files in
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/mnist_tbs_analysis_20260624_plotly/` were
  generated on 2026-06-24 at 19:34 local time; focused tests and artifact
  checks confirmed `Number:` hover templates for the 2D UMAP, visible-label 3D
  UMAP, and docs-style 3D digit-colorbar UMAP pages.
- Repaired the static MNIST TBS report provenance path in
  `scripts/plot_mnist_tbs_analysis_report.py`. The regenerated static report
  in `raw/assets/benchmark-results/mnist_tbs_analysis_20260624/` records
  `generated_at = 2026-06-24T19:42:46+02:00` in the CSV, embeds the timestamp
  in PDF metadata/pages, and adds a visible PNG footer. Focused tests, Ruff,
  and direct artifact checks passed.
- Repaired selected scRNA adaptive-diffusion NNLS report timestamp coverage so
  standalone colored-tree/radial-tree PNG pages receive the `Generated at`
  footer before `savefig`, matching the PDF and CSV provenance. The regenerated
  selected NNLS full-report summary CSV records
  `2026-06-24T19:38:32+02:00`; the one-plot-per-page fit-summary CSV records
  `2026-06-24T19:38:33+02:00`. Focused tests, Ruff, direct artifact checks, and
  PDF metadata checks passed.
- Repaired the Goncalves progenitor-analysis provenance path in
  `scripts/analyze_goncalves_tbs_progenitors.py`. The regenerated
  `goncalves_progenitor_analysis_manifest.json` records
  `generated_at = 2026-06-24T19:45:56+02:00`; the three directly generated
  progenitor plots now include visible PNG footers and PDF metadata. Focused
  tests, Ruff, and direct artifact checks passed.
- Repaired the top-level Goncalves fetal pancreas benchmark provenance path in
  `scripts/goncalves_pancreas_progenitor_benchmark.py`. The benchmark
  `manifest.json` and `summary.md` now record
  `generated_at = 2026-06-24T19:57:27+02:00`; these two files were refreshed
  from existing benchmark outputs without rerunning the full clustering
  benchmark. Focused tests, Ruff, and direct artifact checks passed.
- Repaired the MNIST Plotly 3D hover targets in
  `benchmarks/experiments/mnist/run_higher_categories.py` and
  `scripts/plot_mnist_tbs_analysis_plotly.py`. The regenerated
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/mnist_tbs_analysis_20260624_plotly/index.html`
  records `generated_at = 2026-06-24T20:04:03+02:00`; the 3D MNIST HTML files
  now include larger transparent hover-picking traces whose tooltips begin with
  the true digit `Number:`. Focused tests, Ruff, and direct artifact checks
  passed.
- Repaired the top-level adult pancreas benchmark provenance path in
  `scripts/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark.py`. The adult benchmark
  `manifest.json` and `summary.md` now record
  `generated_at = 2026-06-24T20:07:07+02:00`; these two files were refreshed
  from existing benchmark outputs without rerunning the full clustering
  benchmark. Focused tests, Ruff, py_compile, and direct artifact checks passed.
- Repaired the categorical discrete covariance diagnostic provenance path in
  `scripts/discrete_covariance_guard_diagnostic.py`. The representative
  selected-node and all-suite-root output folders now include `manifest.json`
  files with `generated_at = 2026-06-24T20:10:31+02:00`, created from existing
  CSV outputs without rerunning the diagnostic computations. Focused tests,
  Ruff, py_compile, direct artifact checks, and wiki-lint passed.
- Repaired the benchmark failure-diagnosis report provenance path in
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/failure/debug_trace.py`. Future benchmark
  `failure_report.md` files now include a visible `Generated at:` line, and the
  continuous distributional-action smoke failure report was refreshed from the
  existing comparison CSV with `Generated at: 2026-06-24T20:14:29+02:00`.
  Focused tests, Ruff, py_compile, direct artifact checks, and wiki-lint passed.
- Repaired the scRNA edge gate distance/time report provenance path in
  `scripts/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark.py` and the Goncalves benchmark
  call site. Future adult/Goncalves benchmark runs pass the benchmark
  `generated_at` into `edge_gate_distance_time_model_analysis.md`; the existing
  adult report now records `2026-06-24T20:07:07+02:00` and the Goncalves report
  records `2026-06-24T19:57:27+02:00`. Focused tests, Ruff, py_compile, direct
  artifact checks, and wiki-lint passed.
- Refreshed the recent guarded continuous-covariance benchmark failure reports
  with the timestamped `benchmarks/diagnostics/failure/debug_trace.py` helper.
  The adaptive, original, and integrated guarded benchmark `failure_report.md`
  files now record `Generated at: 2026-06-24T20:20:27+02:00`, regenerated from
  existing comparison CSVs without rerunning the benchmarks. Focused tests,
  Ruff, direct artifact checks, and wiki-lint passed.
- Added explicit provenance to the static adult pancreas
  `tbs_failure_diagnostic.md` artifact. No generator for this Markdown file is
  present in the repo, so the original generation timestamp remains recorded as
  unavailable; the artifact now states that provenance was added at
  `2026-06-24T20:22:42+02:00`. Direct artifact checks and wiki-lint passed.
- Audited recent `20260623`/`20260624` Markdown and HTML report artifacts under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results` for visible timestamp/provenance text. The scan
  found `0` missing current report timestamps after the failure-report,
  distance/time-report, plot-report, MNIST, and static diagnostic repairs.
  This checkpoint covers current report surfaces only; older archived reports
  remain untouched unless they become active evidence.
- Added static provenance manifests for the Gaussian formula-rewrite CSV
  evidence directories `gaussian_inner_node_debug_20260623` and
  `gaussian_within_covariance_test_20260623`. Both manifests record
  `provenance_timestamp = 2026-06-24T20:27:01+02:00`, row and column counts for
  each CSV, and that the original generation timestamp was not recorded.
  Direct manifest/CSV checks and wiki-lint passed.
- Added static provenance for the continuous tree-geometry rethink evidence
  directory `continuous_tree_geometry_rethink_20260623`. The new manifest
  records `provenance_timestamp = 2026-06-24T20:30:09+02:00`, file sizes,
  text-line counts, CSV row/column counts, and that the original text reports
  only carried date-level provenance. Direct manifest/file checks and wiki-lint
  passed.
- Added a root-level static provenance manifest for the selected scRNA NNLS
  report bundle. `scrna_selected_adaptive_diffusion_nnls_manifest.json` ties
  together the full report PDF, individual PNG pages, fit-summary report, and
  summary CSVs; it records `provenance_timestamp =
  2026-06-24T20:32:41+02:00` and preserves the CSV generation timestamps
  `2026-06-24T19:38:32+02:00` and `2026-06-24T19:38:33+02:00`. Direct
  manifest/file checks and wiki-lint passed.
- Repaired the MNIST Plotly UMAP hover labels at
  `2026-06-24T20:39:03+02:00`. The existing 3D writer now includes sample ids
  in its hover `customdata`, and the regenerated 2D/3D MNIST Plotly pages show
  `Number`, `Sample`, and `Best TBS cluster` in point hovers. Focused
  visualization tests, Ruff, direct generated-HTML checks, and wiki-lint
  passed.
- Added a static provenance manifest for the static MNIST TBS report bundle at
  `2026-06-24T20:40:20+02:00`. The new
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/mnist_tbs_analysis_20260624/manifest.json`
  ties together the one-plot-per-page PDF, summary PNG, and summary CSV with
  file sizes, SHA-256 hashes, and the report `generated_at` value
  `2026-06-24T19:42:46+02:00`. Direct manifest/hash/CSV checks, the focused
  static-report timestamp test, Ruff, and wiki-lint passed.
- Repaired the MNIST Plotly report provenance path in
  `scripts/plot_mnist_tbs_analysis_plotly.py`. Regenerating the bundle now
  writes `raw/assets/benchmark-results/mnist_tbs_analysis_20260624_plotly/manifest.json`
  with `generated_at = 2026-06-24T20:43:54+02:00`, source inputs, file sizes,
  SHA-256 hashes, and CSV row/column metadata; the Plotly summary CSV now also
  has a `generated_at` column. Direct manifest/hash/CSV checks, generated HTML
  hover checks, focused visualization tests, Ruff, and wiki-lint passed.
- Repaired the scRNA audit provenance paths in
  `scripts/audit_scrna_branch_length_effects.py` and
  `scripts/audit_scrna_distributional_action.py`. Rerunning the two audit
  generators now writes manifest files for
  `scrna_branch_length_effect_audit_20260624` and
  `scrna_distributional_action_audit_20260624`, each with
  `generated_at = 2026-06-24T20:48:26+02:00`, source inputs, file sizes,
  SHA-256 hashes, and CSV row/column metadata. Direct manifest/hash/CSV/report
  checks, focused pipeline tests, Ruff, and wiki-lint passed.
- Added static provenance for the continuous distributional-action smoke
  diagnostic bundle. The new
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/distributional_action_continuous_smoke_20260624/manifest.json`
  records `provenance_timestamp = 2026-06-24T20:51:24+02:00`, preserves the
  failure-report timestamp `2026-06-24T20:14:29+02:00`, and records file sizes,
  SHA-256 hashes, and CSV row/column counts for the comparison CSV and failure
  report. A follow-up scan of recent `20260623`/`20260624` benchmark-result
  folders found `0` remaining timestamp/provenance coverage gaps. Direct
  manifest checks and wiki-lint passed.
- Added `scripts/verify_recent_benchmark_provenance.py` to make the recent
  benchmark-result provenance scan repeatable. The verifier checks active
  `20260623`/`20260624` result folders for manifest files, visible report
  timestamps, or timestamped CSV headers. It also validates
  `static_artifact_provenance/v1` manifests against current artifact file
  sizes, SHA-256 hashes, text line counts, and CSV row/column counts.
  `tests/pipeline/78_test_recent_benchmark_provenance.py` covers the scan and
  stale-manifest checks with small fixture directories. Running the verifier
  against current `raw/assets/benchmark-results` reported `15` folders checked
  and no gaps; focused pytest, Ruff, and wiki-lint passed.
- Tightened the recent benchmark-result provenance verifier so static artifact
  validation covers every manifest-like JSON file declaring
  `static_artifact_provenance/v1`, including root-level `*_manifest.json` files
  such as the selected scRNA NNLS report manifest. Added a fixture test that
  proves stale row counts are caught in a root-level named manifest; focused
  pytest, Ruff, the live verifier, and wiki-lint passed.
- Tightened static provenance validation again so every
  `static_artifact_provenance/v1` manifest must carry a top-level
  `generated_at` or `provenance_timestamp`. The current active static manifests
  already satisfy this, and the new fixture test proves a timestamp-free static
  manifest fails validation. Focused pytest, Ruff, the live verifier, and
  wiki-lint passed.
- Extended the recent benchmark-result provenance verifier to validate
  `plot_manifest.json` summaries. Rows marked `present`,
  `orphaned_existing_file`, or `unclassified_existing_file` now have their plot
  paths, byte counts, and SHA-256 hashes checked against the filesystem, and
  `plot_count`, `status_counts`, and `role_counts` must match the manifest
  rows. The new check caught stale Goncalves progenitor plot hashes, so
  `scripts/run_scrna_plot_pipeline.py --dataset goncalves --strict` was rerun
  without rerunning plot generators; the refreshed Goncalves plot manifest
  records `generated_at = 2026-06-24T21:06:45+02:00` with `74` rows
  (`66` present, `8` orphaned existing files). Focused pytest, Ruff, the live
  verifier, and wiki-lint passed.
- Extended the same verifier to cross-check each `plot_manifest.csv` against
  its sibling `plot_manifest.json`. The CSV row count and each row's `plot_id`,
  `path`, `role`, `status`, `sha256`, and `bytes` fields must now match the
  JSON rows, closing a second stale-report surface for the scRNA plot pipeline.
  Current adult pancreas and Goncalves plot manifests already satisfy the rule;
  the focused fixture proves a stale CSV status is rejected. Focused pytest,
  Ruff, the live verifier, and wiki-lint passed.
- Extended recent manifest timestamp validation beyond static manifests. Every
  manifest-like JSON file under active `20260623`/`20260624` result paths must
  now carry one of `generated_at`, `provenance_timestamp`, or legacy
  `run_at_utc`; the continuous guarded covariance benchmark manifests already
  satisfy this through `run_at_utc`, so no artifact rewrite was needed. The
  verifier CLI was also renamed to `--skip-manifest-validation` while keeping
  `--skip-static-manifest-validation` as a compatibility alias. Focused pytest,
  Ruff, the live verifier, and wiki-lint passed.
- Extended recent manifest validation to check top-level file-reference fields
  ending in `_csv`, `_md`, or `_json`. This covers generic benchmark manifests
  that name result tables and failure reports outside the static-artifact
  schema. The current active manifests reference `19` such CSV/Markdown/JSON
  paths and all exist; the focused fixture proves a missing current
  `results_csv` is rejected while older inactive dated manifests remain outside
  the scan. Focused pytest, Ruff, the live verifier, and wiki-lint passed.
- Extended recent manifest validation to check local `source_script`,
  `source_scripts`, and `source_inputs` paths. The audit found one stale source
  provenance entry in the static MNIST report manifest:
  `ward_e0.001_s0.05_top_cluster_digit_composition.csv` did not exist. The
  manifest now points to the actual best-run source file
  `ward_e0.0001_s0.0001_top_cluster_digit_composition.csv`, matching the static
  report generator's best-ARI key. The focused fixture proves a missing current
  `source_script` is rejected while older inactive dated manifests remain
  outside the scan. Focused pytest, Ruff, the live verifier, and wiki-lint
  passed.
- Extended static artifact manifest validation to check declared
  `generated_at_values` for CSV artifacts. When a static manifest declares the
  expected generated timestamp values, the verifier now reads the CSV
  `generated_at` column and compares the unique values against the manifest.
  The current static MNIST report CSV and MNIST Plotly summary CSV already
  match their declared timestamp values; the focused fixture proves stale
  declared CSV timestamps are rejected. Focused pytest, Ruff, the live verifier,
  and wiki-lint passed.
- Extended plot-manifest validation to check local `generator_script`
  provenance for every plot row. Semicolon-separated generator script lists are
  split and checked as local paths unless the value is `unknown` or an external
  reference. The current adult pancreas and Goncalves plot manifests already
  point to existing generator scripts; the focused fixture proves a missing
  plot generator script is rejected while the plot artifact itself can otherwise
  be valid. Focused pytest, Ruff, the live verifier, and wiki-lint passed.
- Regenerated the MNIST Plotly report after making the UMAP hover labels
  explicit about the true digit number. The 2D UMAP, three-panel 3D UMAP,
  visible-label 3D UMAP, and docs-style 3D UMAP pages now start their hover
  labels with `Digit number:`. The focused Plotly hover regression tests and
  Ruff passed.
- Extended plot-manifest validation to check exact local `input_tables` entries
  for active `present` plot rows. Wildcard, unknown, and external inputs remain
  skipped because they are not exact file claims. The current adult pancreas and
  Goncalves plot manifests contain 160 exact present-row input-table references,
  all of which resolve; the focused fixture proves a stale exact input table is
  rejected. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark provenance
  verifier passed.
- Extended plot-manifest CSV parity validation from the original core fields
  to every field present in `plot_manifest.csv`. The current adult pancreas and
  Goncalves plot manifest CSV files already match their JSON rows for all CSV
  header fields, including `generator_script`, `input_tables`, `notes`, and
  stage metadata; the focused fixture proves a stale CSV `input_tables` value is
  rejected. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark provenance
  verifier passed.
- Extended recent benchmark manifest validation from timestamp presence to
  parseable ISO timestamp values for `generated_at`, `provenance_timestamp`, and
  `run_at_utc`. All 23 current manifest timestamp values under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results` parse successfully; focused fixtures now reject
  malformed recent, static, and plot-manifest timestamps. Focused pytest, Ruff,
  and the live recent benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Extended recent CSV timestamp validation so CSV files with `generated_at` or
  `provenance_timestamp` columns must contain at least one non-empty parseable
  ISO timestamp value per timestamp column. The current recent benchmark CSVs
  contain six timestamp values and all parse successfully; focused fixtures now
  reject malformed and empty recent CSV timestamp columns while ignoring older
  inactive folders outside the scan pattern. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live
  recent benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Extended recent text/HTML timestamp validation so files with explicit
  timestamp labels such as `Generated at` or `Provenance timestamp` must include
  parseable ISO timestamp values. The current recent benchmark markdown/HTML
  reports contain 12 timestamp labels, including the MNIST Plotly HTML index,
  and all parse successfully after simple HTML tag stripping; focused fixtures
  now reject timestamp labels without parseable values and accept the current
  HTML generated-at format. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark
  provenance verifier passed.
- Extended static artifact manifest validation so CSV artifacts with
  `generated_at` or `provenance_timestamp` columns must declare the matching
  unique timestamp values in the manifest. This found a real metadata gap in
  `scrna_selected_adaptive_diffusion_nnls_manifest.json`; its two timestamped
  CSV artifact records now declare `generated_at_values` matching the current
  CSV contents. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark provenance
  verifier passed.
- Extended static artifact manifest validation to check declared local
  `source_script`, `source_scripts`, and `source_inputs` paths even for
  root-level static manifests whose filenames do not match the active date
  pattern. The current static manifests declare 20 local source references and
  all resolve; three older static manifests have no source fields and were not
  forced to add new claims. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark
  provenance verifier passed.
- Extended static artifact manifest validation to require `sha256` for every
  listed artifact, not just compare hashes when they happen to be present. This
  found 28 artifact records without hashes across the continuous geometry,
  Gaussian debug/covariance, and selected scRNA NNLS static manifests; each now
  records a `sha256` computed from the current artifact file. Focused pytest,
  Ruff, and the live recent benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Extended static artifact manifest validation to require `bytes` for every
  listed artifact, not just compare byte counts when present. This found 13
  artifact records without byte counts in the continuous geometry and Gaussian
  debug/covariance static manifests; each now records the current artifact file
  size. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark provenance verifier
  passed.
- Extended static artifact manifest validation to require `rows` and `columns`
  for every CSV artifact, not just compare shape metadata when present. The
  current static manifests already had complete shape metadata for all 24 CSV
  artifacts, so no artifact metadata repair was required. Focused pytest, Ruff,
  and the live recent benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Extended static artifact manifest validation to require `lines` for plain
  text artifacts (`.md` and `.txt`), not just compare line counts when present.
  This found three markdown artifact records without line counts in the
  distributional-action smoke and scRNA audit manifests; each now records the
  current file line count. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark
  provenance verifier passed.
- Extended plot-manifest validation so each `plot_manifest.json` pins its
  sibling `plot_manifest.csv` with `manifest_csv_bytes` and
  `manifest_csv_sha256`, in addition to row-by-row parity checks. The adult
  pancreas and Goncalves plot manifests now record byte counts and SHA-256
  hashes for their CSV manifests. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent
  benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Extended manifest timestamp validation beyond the core top-level timestamp
  fields to any top-level field whose name contains `timestamp` or
  `generated_at`, including list-valued fields such as
  `generated_artifact_timestamps`. Current recent/static manifest timestamp-like
  fields parse successfully; the focused fixture now rejects malformed
  timestamp-list entries. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark
  provenance verifier passed.
- Regenerated the MNIST Plotly report after enlarging all 3D UMAP transparent
  hover-target traces to 24 px so hovering over dense digit labels exposes the
  `Digit number` tooltip more reliably. The focused hover tests, Ruff, and the
  live recent benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Extended recent manifest reference validation so top-level `_csv`, `_md`, and
  `_json` path claims are checked when stored as either strings or lists of
  strings. The current recent manifests only use string-valued reference fields,
  but the regression fixture now covers list-valued `results_csv`; focused
  pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Tightened manifest source/reference path-field validation so malformed
  declared path fields are reported instead of being skipped. The current recent
  manifests use valid string or list-of-string source/reference fields; focused
  fixtures now reject malformed `results_csv` and `source_inputs` fields, and
  focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark provenance verifier
  passed.
- Tightened static artifact numeric metadata validation so `bytes`, `rows`,
  `columns`, and `lines` must be real JSON integers, not booleans or other
  types that can compare equal accidentally in Python. The current static
  artifact manifests already use integer numeric metadata; focused fixtures now
  reject boolean byte and CSV-shape metadata, and focused pytest, Ruff, and the
  live recent benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Tightened plot-manifest numeric metadata validation so `plot_count`,
  `manifest_csv_bytes`, and per-plot `bytes` must be real JSON integers. The
  current adult pancreas and Goncalves plot manifests already use integer
  numeric metadata; focused fixtures now reject boolean plot-count, manifest
  CSV byte, and plot byte fields, and focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent
  benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Hardened plot-manifest row validation so non-object rows are reported as row
  errors instead of crashing during `status_counts` or `role_counts`
  recomputation. Current adult pancreas and Goncalves plot manifests contain
  only object rows; the focused malformed-row fixture now returns a clean
  validation error, and focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark
  provenance verifier passed.
- Tightened static artifact string metadata validation so artifact `sha256`
  values must be non-empty strings and CSV timestamp-value declarations such as
  `generated_at_values` must be lists of strings. Current static artifact
  manifests already satisfy these type contracts; focused fixtures now reject
  boolean hashes and malformed timestamp-value lists, and focused pytest, Ruff,
  and the live recent benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Tightened plot-manifest hash metadata validation so `manifest_csv_sha256` and
  per-plot `sha256` values must be non-empty strings before digest comparison.
  Current adult pancreas and Goncalves plot manifests already satisfy these
  type contracts; focused fixtures now reject boolean manifest-CSV and plot hash
  fields, and focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent benchmark provenance
  verifier passed.
- Tightened plot-manifest count-map validation so `status_counts` and
  `role_counts` must be dictionaries from strings to real JSON integers before
  comparing them with recomputed row counts. Current adult pancreas and
  Goncalves plot manifests already satisfy this type contract; the focused
  fixture now rejects boolean count values, and focused pytest, Ruff, and the
  live recent benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Tightened manifest timestamp-field validation so timestamp-like fields must
  hold ISO timestamp strings or lists of ISO timestamp strings, while
  non-timestamp provenance fields such as `report_generated_at_source` remain
  allowed. Removed four `original_generation_timestamp: null` entries from
  repaired manifests where notes already state that the original generation
  timestamp was not recorded. Focused pytest, Ruff, and the live recent
  benchmark provenance verifier passed.
- Regenerated the MNIST Plotly report after changing the 2D and 3D UMAP hover
  traces to carry resolved per-point hover text such as `Digit number: 0`,
  rather than relying only on Plotly `customdata` placeholders. The focused
  MNIST hover regression tests, Ruff, and a Chrome-side Plotly data check
  passed.
- Added a canonical matched adult/Goncalves selected NNLS-TBS report so both
  scRNA analyses use the same page structure: selected-cluster UMAP, real full
  radial tree, metric box, and cluster-size/dominant-label panel. The matched
  report writes a timestamped PDF, two page PNGs, a summary CSV, and a manifest;
  focused py_compile, Ruff, and the selected scRNA timestamp regression passed.

### 2026-06-25

- Added `scripts/plot_goncalves_progenitor_coherence.py` to render a compact
  quantitative Goncalves progenitor coherence plot for the selected clear
  progenitor structures (`C6`, `C1`, `N2851`, `N2876`, `N2910`) versus broad
  mixed neighborhoods (`C22`, `N2907`). The score is
  `mean(dominant_population_fraction, progenitor_population_fraction)`, with
  component fractions overlaid as points and group means shown as dashed
  reference lines. The script writes PNG, PDF, CSV, and static provenance
  manifest artifacts under the Goncalves benchmark result folder; py_compile
  and Ruff passed.
- Published the full MNIST result bundle to GitHub Pages at
  `https://enessakalliuniwien.github.io/tree-break-selection/mnist/results/`.
  The upload includes the Plotly report, 2D/3D UMAP pages, digit image
  inspectors, summary CSVs, UMAP coordinates, static PNG summary, and static
  one-plot-per-page PDF. A direct assignment audit confirmed `2,000/2,000`
  UMAP coordinate rows match the saved alpha-sweep assignment rows by sample id,
  with `0` true-digit mismatches and `0` best-cluster mismatches for the
  displayed Ward `edge_alpha=0.0001`, `sibling_alpha=0.0001` run.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/robust_root_center_smoke.py` to
  test whether robust center estimators help recover a latent high-dimensional
  root anchor. The diagnostic writes row, summary, and manifest artifacts under
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/robust_root_center_smoke_20260625/`; geometric
  median and continuous approximate halfspace-depth centers improve root-anchor
  recovery under outliers, while observed-point medoid/depth proxies fail in
  high dimensions and the result remains diagnostic-only rather than a
  selected-root topology rescue. Added
  [[robust-root-center-smoke-20260625]] to the wiki; py_compile and Ruff passed.
- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/robust_center_rooted_tree_smoke.py`
  to compare centroid-rooted, geometric-median-rooted, and Tukey-depth-rooted
  versions of the same unrooted average-linkage tree. The default `5%`
  side-size guard often lets all methods select the same outlier-isolating
  root edge in outlier scenarios, so robust centers improve center error but
  not the root edge. A `15%` guard sensitivity reduces that trivial root and
  shows modest robust-rooting branch-integrity gains in some outlier rows, but
  not a general centroid replacement. Added
  [[robust-center-rooted-tree-smoke-20260625]] to the wiki.
- Reduced redundant code in gate and AWS benchmark infrastructure. Shared gate
  annotation predicates now live in
  `tree_break_selection/hierarchy_analysis/decomposition/gates/annotation_predicates.py`
  and are reused by the gate orchestrator and spectral-transport support.
  Shared AWS Batch shard-index resolution now lives in
  `benchmarks/shared/env.py` and is re-exported by the cloud benchmark wrappers.
  Shared validation-report envelope and metadata checks now live in
  `benchmarks/validation/report_contract.py` and are reused by the feature
  covariance and selected-PCA projected-Wald validation scripts. Also removed
  the focused Ruff `F401/F841` leftovers from two spectral diagnostics.
  Touched-file Ruff, gate traversal/config tests, AWS wrapper tests,
  selected-edge AWS validation tests, validation-report tests, and `make
  wiki-lint` passed.
- Removed active legacy TBS method wiring from the Python codebase. Deleted the
  vendored `tree_break_selection/legacy_methods/` implementation, the legacy
  commit runner, legacy comparison panels/tests, and the old/current method
  difference ledger. The method registry, method sets, allGO matrix scripts,
  root-tail diagnostics, nearest-support/action-ladder/action-dominance
  diagnostics, kernel-tail diagnostics, population-law/H_u diagnostics, and
  hard-negative replay contracts now expose current-only method surfaces.
  Legacy method IDs remain only in absence assertions. Touched-file Ruff,
  full `F401/F841` scan, targeted dispatch/path-conditioned/root-tail/kernel
  validation tests, and contract searches passed.

### 2026-06-26

- Ran the categorical adaptive-diffusion fixed-coordinate benchmark and focused
  audit for the quantized Gaussian overlap and `phylo_large` rows. Added
  [[categorical-adaptive-diffusion-focus-audit-20260626]], which records that
  adaptive topology alone determines the focus-case partitions: quantized
  Gaussian losses are mostly pure over-fragmentation, phylo-large losses are
  mostly taxon merges, and NNLS branch-time refitting leaves those assignments
  unchanged.
- Installed and verified the Graphviz-backed `pygraphviz` plotting path,
  enabled radial benchmark tree plots by default, added a default UMAP
  embedding cache for plotted full runs, fixed dense radial tree legend
  clipping, and reran the plotted full benchmark at
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260626_1506_full_radial_plots_layoutfix/`. Added
  [[full-radial-plots-benchmark-run-20260626]] to record the PDF/UMAP/tree
  artifacts and the quantized Gaussian plus `phylo_large` observations.
- Extracted the `gauss_overlap_3c_small_q4/q5` examples to
  `benchmarks/results/focus_gauss_overlap_q4_q5_20260626/`, including
  assignments, cluster crosstabs, UMAP page PNGs, node stats, and p-value
  traces. The focused traces show `tbs_diffusion` merges true classes `1` and
  `2` because the `200`-sample branch has open edge gates but corrected sibling
  p-values just above `0.01` (`0.01220272` for q4 and `0.01091002` for q5),
  while plain TBS splits the analogous branch with corrected sibling p-values
  below alpha.
- Clarified diffusion method naming in the benchmark registry and extracted
  q4/q5 metadata: `tbs_diffusion` is displayed as
  `TBS (Hamming NN Diffusion)` with `diffusion_method=hamming_nn_diffusion`,
  while `tbs_diffusion_adaptive` is displayed as
  `TBS (Adaptive pydiffmap Diffusion)`. TBS-family benchmark rows now record
  `branch_length_optimization_method`, defaulting to `linkage_ultrametric`, and
  the diffusion dispatch path can forward fixed-topology NNLS branch-length
  settings when configured.

### 2026-06-27

- Reran the full plotted 121-case benchmark with
  `tbs_diffusion_adaptive` replacing Hamming NN diffusion. Added
  [[full-adaptive-pydiffmap-benchmark-run-20260627]], which records that
  adaptive pydiffmap diffusion recovers the quantized Gaussian overlap q3/q4/q5
  rows exactly, improves `phylo_large_32taxa` to ARI `0.9770`, remains partial
  on `phylo_large_64taxa` at ARI `0.5612`, and averages ARI `0.531196` over
  ok rows with `106` ok rows and `15` skips.
- Added [[phylo-large-adaptive-pydiffmap-focus-audit-20260627]] after a
  focused `phylo_large` rerun. The audit records that raw categorical Hamming
  separates every true taxon in both large phylogenetic cases, while adaptive
  pydiffmap keeps strict sample gaps for only `30/64` taxa in
  `phylo_large_64taxa`, reducing nearest-neighbor label purity and leaving
  mixed final boundaries with closed sibling gates. `phylo_large_32taxa`
  remains a pure-fragmentation case with no mixed final clusters.
- Added optional `tbs_diffusion_graphtools` as
  `TBS (graphtools Kernel Diffusion)` under the GPL-isolated
  `experimental-gpl` dependency extra, then ran the five-case focus benchmark
  in `benchmarks/results/focus_graphtools_diffusion_20260627/`. Added
  [[graphtools-diffusion-focus-benchmark-20260627]], which records exact
  recovery on quantized Gaussian q3/q4/q5, `phylo_large_32taxa` at ARI
  `0.902655` with `29` clusters, and `phylo_large_64taxa` at ARI `0.709257`
  with `102` clusters. The result improves the 64-taxon adaptive pydiffmap
  row but remains experimental rather than canonical.
- Installed and synced the scRNA dependency extra (`scanpy` and `anndata`),
  reran the adult pancreas and Goncalves fetal pancreas scRNA benchmarks into
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/scrna_space_decomposition_rerun_20260627/`,
  then added `scripts/analyze_scrna_space_decomposition.py` for an
  invariant/equivariant PCA-space diagnostic. Added
  [[scrna-space-decomposition-rerun-20260627]], which records that adult
  pancreas celltype separation is stronger in equivariant radius than the
  invariant axis, while the Goncalves subset shows weak celltype separation in
  this diagnostic.
- Added `benchmarks/validation/alpha_structure_sweep.py` and ran focused plus
  Cartesian alpha sweeps for quantized Gaussian overlap and `phylo_large`
  adaptive-diffusion cases. Added [[alpha-structure-sweep-20260627]], which
  records p-value boundary margins, partition transitions, and the main
  methodological finding that `phylo_large_64taxa` structure changes with
  sibling alpha while edge gates are saturated across the compact tested edge
  alpha range.

### 2026-06-28

- Added `raw/inbox/adaptive-alpha-method-literature-20260628.md` and
  [[adaptive-alpha-gate-design-20260628]], recording a conservative adaptive
  alpha design: keep edge alpha fixed initially, make sibling alpha the
  adaptive-resolution axis, report `sibling_alpha_required`, use
  no-perturbation test-context guards for relaxed sibling splits, and avoid
  adaptive FDR claims until selected-hierarchy calibration exists.
- Promoted fixed-topology NNLS branch-time into the shared benchmark setup as
  `tbs_diffusion_adaptive_nnls`, a default adaptive pydiffmap method that uses
  `edge_branch_length_variance_policy="normalized_branch_length"` with fitted
  `fixed_topology_nnls` branch lengths. Diffusion dispatch now forwards the
  branch-length variance policy into the TBS runner, while
  `tbs_diffusion_adaptive` remains available as the linkage-ultrametric
  baseline.
- Ran the full `121`-case benchmark with plots and relationship analysis
  disabled after promoting `tbs_diffusion_adaptive_nnls`. Added
  [[full-adaptive-nnls-benchmark-run-20260628]], which records
  `tbs_diffusion_adaptive_nnls` mean ok-row ARI `0.736107`, `106` ok rows and
  `15` skips, paired ARI delta `+0.359403` versus `tbs_diffusion`, exact q4/q5
  quantized Gaussian recovery, improved `phylo_large` rows, and remaining
  high-dimensional categorical regressions plus sibling-inflation/`kth`
  skip modes.
- Added focused regression/skip diagnostics under
  `reports/adaptive_nnls_regression_analysis_20260628/` and
  [[adaptive-nnls-regression-skip-analysis-20260628]]. The analysis separates
  adaptive-pydiffmap topology regressions from NNLS branch-length effects:
  most top finite regressions match the adaptive-linkage baseline before NNLS,
  while `dim_consolidated_4c_24f` changes only after NNLS branch refitting.
  The `kth(=6)` skips reproduce in pydiffmap adaptive bandwidth construction
  before TBS or NNLS runs; strict sibling-inflation skips remain calibration
  support-contract failures.
- Extended the adaptive NNLS regression analysis beyond ARI by adding
  multi-metric deltas and aggregate win/loss/tie reports for NMI, AMI,
  V-measure, macro F1, split errors, fragmentation metrics, and finite
  unsupervised shape metrics. The broader view keeps the positive full-run
  conclusion but separates broad quality regressions
  (`cat_overlap_3cat_4c`, `overlap_unbal_4c_small`, `overlap_mod_4c_small`,
  `dim_consolidated_4c_24f`) from mixed ARI/fragmentation-sensitive rows such
  as `cat_highd_3cat_500feat` and `gauss_overlap_3c_small`.
- Added the independent-metric context table for the adaptive NNLS regression
  cases. The update narrows the broad unsupervised regression set:
  `cat_overlap_3cat_4c` and `overlap_mod_4c_small` degrade across all checked
  independent compactness/balance metrics, `overlap_unbal_4c_small` degrades
  on most with a Davies-Bouldin exception, `gauss_overlap_8c_highd` is
  over-fragmentation with broad independent degradation, while
  `dim_consolidated_4c_24f` is label-alignment/NNLS-gate semantic regression
  despite mostly improved independent metrics.
- Installed the optional `experimental-gpl` extra and restored the full
  dev/benchmark/viz/scrna extras, making `graphtools 2.1.0` available under
  `uv run`. Added a seven-case diffusion-backend plus NNLS panel under
  `reports/adaptive_nnls_regression_analysis_20260628/`. The panel shows that
  pydiffmap topology, not NNLS, drives most current over-fragmentation;
  `dim_consolidated_4c_24f` is NNLS-sensitive across Hamming, pydiffmap, and
  graphtools; and graphtools repairs `cat_highd_3cat_500feat` and
  `gauss_overlap_8c_highd` but over-fragments `gauss_overlap_3c_small`.
- Registered `tbs_diffusion_graphtools_nnls` as a named optional GPL benchmark
  method and ran it through the full `121`-case suite with plots and
  relationship analysis disabled. Added
  [[full-graphtools-nnls-benchmark-run-20260630]], recording `117` ok rows,
  `4` skips, mean ok-row ARI `0.741645`, NMI `0.761942`, macro F1 `0.811544`,
  strong high-dimensional categorical and phylogenetic repairs, and mixed
  paired behavior versus pydiffmap NNLS (`15` wins, `70` ties, `19` losses by
  ARI on paired finite rows).
- Added `tbs_diffusion_graphtools_adaptive_nnls` as an optional GPL
  graphtools diffusion method with fixed-topology NNLS branch times and a
  `fragmentation_guard` adaptive-kNN profile. Ran the seven-case
  diffusion/NNLS focus panel under `reports/graphtools_adaptive_k_20260630/`
  and added [[graphtools-adaptive-k-nnls-focus-benchmark-20260630]]. The
  focused evidence shows the guard keeps K `10` on the panel, matches fixed-K
  graphtools NNLS, repairs `cat_highd_3cat_500feat` and
  `gauss_overlap_8c_highd` versus pydiffmap NNLS, but leaves
  `dim_consolidated_4c_24f` and `gauss_overlap_3c_small` over-fragmented.
- Expanded adaptive-K graphtools NNLS tree inference to all applicable
  diffusion-distance tree builders: SciPy average, complete, weighted, single,
  centroid, median, Ward linkage, and MAD-rooted neighbor joining. Added a
  topology-only linkage fallback for nonmonotone centroid/median merge heights
  when fixed-topology NNLS will replace placeholder branch lengths. Reran the
  seven-case panel under
  `reports/graphtools_adaptive_k_tree_inference_20260630/` and added
  [[graphtools-adaptive-k-tree-inference-focus-benchmark-20260630]], recording
  `56` ok rows, weighted linkage as the best mean-ARI topology (`0.831689`),
  centroid as best on `cat_overlap_3cat_4c`, Ward as best on
  `overlap_mod_4c_small`, neighbor joining as best on
  `dim_consolidated_4c_24f`, and weighted/single/centroid/NJ repairs for
  `gauss_overlap_3c_small`.

### 2026-06-29

- Added [[paper-figure-map-20260629]], a bundle-level map of generated paper
  figure surfaces. The map separates the one current manuscript-wired TikZ
  figure from toy explanatory figures, adult/Goncalves scRNA plot surfaces,
  the 2026-06-27 scRNA space-decomposition rerun, scRNA audit and selected-NNLS
  report pages, GO/subspace figure decks, MNIST static/interactive figures,
  and legacy Julia/conditional diagnostic pools.

### 2026-06-30

- Cleaned the shared benchmark contract around explicit grid-search rows:
  added benchmark row annotations (`run_id`, `benchmark_class`,
  `benchmark_grid`, `benchmark_repeat`), a reusable Cartesian grid helper with
  repeats, duplicate `run_id` validation, and full-run resume tracking by
  `run_id`. Consolidated the optional graphtools adaptive-K NNLS tree-topology
  variants into one method with an eight-cell tree-strategy grid instead of
  duplicate method IDs, and documented the benchmark classification and grid
  contract in `benchmarks/README.md`.
- Added the canonical benchmark performance-grid writer. Full benchmark runs
  now emit `benchmark_performance_grid.md`,
  `benchmark_performance_grid_summary.csv`, and case-by-run ARI, NMI, purity,
  and status grids so method/grid-cell performance is visible directly from
  the run directory rather than inferred from the raw comparison CSV.
- Ran the canonical full benchmark grid with default methods, plots,
  manifold, and relationship analysis disabled under
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260630_202253Z_full_performance_grid_default/`.
  The run completed `1210` method-case rows across `121` cases and `10` run
  cells, emitted the performance-grid artifacts and failure report, and showed
  oracle-k baselines leading mean ARI while TBS-family methods had high median
  ARI on applicable rows but substantial skip and stress-case sensitivity.
  Clarified the grid summary rank column as `rank_skip_rate_then_mean_ari`
  because the report intentionally sorts skip-free run cells before comparing
  available-row mean ARI.
- Reran the seven-case adaptive-K graphtools NNLS tree-inference panel to
  capture labels for all eight topology strategies, then added
  [[graphtools-adaptive-k-tree-consensus-focus-benchmark-20260630]]. The
  consensus analysis records `56` ok rows, `21,280` label assignments, and
  `196` pairwise partition-agreement rows; its final label-free selector uses
  internal fit, a small parsimony term, a dominant-cluster guard, and
  agreement tie-breaks, improving mean ARI by `+0.119951` over average linkage
  and landing within mean ARI `0.001710` of the external per-case best
  topology on the focus panel.

### 2026-07-06

- Implemented and ran the full-grid adaptive-K graphtools NNLS tree consensus
  gate. The full `121`-case run under
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260706_170815Z_full_graphtools_tree_consensus/`
  produced `968` result rows across the eight topology cells, `925` ok rows,
  `43` skips, and `221,800` persisted label assignments. Added
  [[full-graphtools-tree-consensus-gate-20260706]], recording
  `gate_status = pass`: completeness, label integrity, label-free invariance,
  paired mean/median ARI, NMI, macro F1, and category-level regression checks
  all pass for the frozen selector, while production-default promotion remains
  a separate decision.
- Added a fail-closed breakdown for the full tree-consensus gate: the `20`
  `skip_no_valid_topology` selections consist of `14` real multi-cluster
  one-cluster under-splits, `4` expected/null one-cluster rows that lack
  two-cluster internal metrics, and `2` all-cell calibration/support failures.
  The `43` skipped run cells are mostly localized topology-cell failures; only
  `30` sit inside fail-closed selection cases and `13` occur in cases that
  still receive a selected topology.

### 2026-07-07

- Reviewed the current diff as a contract cleanup pass. Clarified setup docs so
  the lean development environment is separate from the full test environment
  that includes scRNA and GPL extras, made the Goncalves scRNA benchmark module
  import without eager `anndata`, and refactored decomposition internals toward a
  slimmer engine: immutable `DecompositionConfig`, compact default traversal
  counters, explicit `trace_level="full"` diagnostics, and a separate
  sibling-gate profile registry under `decomposition/gates/profiles.py`.
  Extracted root-stability and selected-permutation guard layers into
  `decomposition/gates/guards.py` while preserving the public orchestrator
  imports used by existing callers.

### 2026-07-09

- Ran a focused p-value and traversal audit for the `14` real multi-cluster
  under-splits inside the full adaptive-K graphtools NNLS tree-consensus gate's
  `skip_no_valid_topology` selections. The audit writes
  `reports/tree_consensus_fail_closed_pvalues_20260709/fail_closed_pvalue_report.md`,
  `fail_closed_loss_taxonomy.csv`, cell p-value tables, live/full-edge
  traversal traces, and an external fallback audit. The loss-site split is `9`
  global edge-gate closures and `5` sibling-gate closures after edge support:
  no weighted topology cell rescues the cases, while current default `tbs`
  helps only a subset and has its own support skips. The skipped diagnostic
  topology cells are runtime support/precondition failures; the separate
  packaging issue is that local `graphtools` and `tasklogger` metadata report
  GPLv2 licenses.
- Ran a focused sibling-alpha sweep for the five edge-supported fail-closed
  cases using `sibling_alpha` values `0.015`, `0.025`, `0.05`, `0.10`, and
  `0.20` on topology cells with existing edge-open traversal. The resulting
  `reports/tree_consensus_alpha_sensitivity_20260709/alpha_sensitivity_report.md`
  shows alpha-only relaxation is not an adequate overlap fix:
  `overlap_heavy_8c_large_feat` needs `sibling_alpha = 0.20` for weak recovery
  with ARI `0.076480` and `22` clusters, while `overlap_extreme_4c` remains
  effectively unrecovered at ARI `0.000107`.
- Added and ran a pass-through-aware literature-policy replay in
  `benchmarks/validation/tree_literature_alpha_replay.py`, writing
  `reports/tree_consensus_literature_policy_replay_20260709/literature_policy_replay_report.md`.
  The replay covers current traversal, hierarchical FDR, TreeBH-style
  multiresolution BH, dependence-robust BY, graphical alpha recycling,
  selective-inference-required, randomized-alpha-spending-required, and a
  trace-only adaptive alpha proxy. The formal `0.01` budget procedures rescue
  `0/14` fail-closed cases; the exact selective/randomized variants fail
  closed because their required p-value objects are absent; the adaptive proxy
  opens only `sbm_moderate` and one weak dominant
  `overlap_heavy_8c_large_feat` candidate. The new
  `literature_policy_replay_requirement_audit.csv` records one row per
  requested literature family with paper-exact status and production
  interpretation. A companion `20`-replicate binary null FDR smoke records
  algorithmic synthetic-p control, fixed/selected-tree Wald over-rejection, and
  selected-inflated support failures.
- Added and ran a BranchArchitect-backed rebuilt-tree comparison for the `14`
  real multi-cluster fail-closed under-splits in
  `benchmarks/validation/brancharchitect_tree_comparison.py`, writing
  `reports/tree_consensus_brancharchitect_tree_comparison_20260709/brancharchitect_tree_comparison_report.md`.
  The run rebuilt `112` adaptive-K graphtools NNLS topology cells (`101` ok,
  `11` skips), emitted branch-length Newick strings and `315` pairwise tree
  comparisons, and loaded BranchArchitect from `TBS_BRANCHARCHITECT_PATH` for
  RF/weighted-RF plus leaf-capped interpolation events. All successful cells
  still returned one cluster, so topology and NNLS branch-path differences do
  not change the fail-closed cluster structure; the remaining loss is upstream
  edge/sibling support and selected-hierarchy calibration.
- Added and ran a topology/subtree difference diagnosis in
  `benchmarks/validation/tree_topology_difference_diagnosis.py`, writing
  `reports/tree_consensus_topology_difference_diagnosis_20260709/topology_difference_diagnosis_report.md`.
  The diagnosis parses BranchArchitect branch-length Newick exports, emits
  `9,106` rooted subtree-support rows and `168` ranked unstable-subtree
  highlights, and explains why topology cells differ without rescuing the
  cluster structure. Continuous edge-closed cases are dominated by
  stable-core-vs-centroid/median clade contrasts; overlap/SBM cases contain
  large unstable subtrees supported by one or a small subset of topology
  methods. The resulting statistical direction is a selected-pipeline edge
  null for edge-closed cases and a topology/branch-length-conditioned selected
  sibling null plus topology-stability alpha spending for edge-supported
  cases, not a global alpha increase.
- Added and ran the selected-node sibling-null law diagnostic in
  `benchmarks/validation/selected_node_sibling_null_law.py`, writing
  `reports/selected_node_sibling_null_law_20260709/selected_node_sibling_null_law_report.md`.
  The report formalizes the fixed conditional statistic and the missing
  selected law
  `P_0(W_v >= W_obs | E_sel(T,v,k,U,ell,Sigma,topology_stability),
  H0_sibling(v))`, records seven law components, emits ten deterministic
  smaller examples for sample-size, NNLS branch-length, covariance/eigenvector,
  multiplicity, and accepted-dimension effects, and preserves the empirical
  split of `5` edge-supported selected-node sibling-law cases versus `9`
  selected-pipeline edge-null cases. The generated report now includes a
  selective-inference literature anchor and an explicit requirement-coverage
  section for the requested mathematical/statistical ingredients.
- Extended the selected-node law diagnostic with an adaptive-law benchmark
  replay, writing
  `reports/selected_node_adaptive_law_replay_20260709/selected_node_adaptive_law_replay_report.md`.
  The strict selected-law policy opens `0/14` cases because exact
  selected-node conditional p-values are still absent; the
  topology/branch/covariance spending proxy also opens `0/14`; the
  no-stability ablation opens only `sbm_moderate` in `3` topology cells. The
  nearest prior rerun at `sibling_alpha = 0.20` has ARI `0.071841`, NMI
  `0.171602`, macro F1 `0.472963`, and `6` clusters, so this replay remains
  diagnostic evidence rather than promotion support.
- Diagnosed why the strict selected-node replay opens `0/14` cases. The strict
  policy is hard-coded to fail before evaluating either edge state or an input
  p-value, and no selected-node conditional p-value exists in the replay schema
  or benchmark output. The aggregate result also mixes `9` upstream edge-gate
  failures with only `5` selected-node sibling-law cases; their `38` root-cell
  decisions comprise `20` edge-open cells with ordinary p-values and `18`
  edge-closed cells. The formal conditioning event is not yet executable by
  naive rejection Monte Carlo because exact continuous NNLS lengths,
  covariance, eigenvectors, and stability values define a probability-zero
  match. Recorded the required repair direction: condition on discrete
  selection state, recompute or validly condition continuous nuisance
  quantities, and build separate local-null generators for binary overlap, SBM
  adjacency, and continuous low-rank contexts.
- Audited the distance, topology-inference, and branch-time layers for the
  fourteen real fail-closed cases. The frozen adaptive graphtools method uses
  raw-coordinate Hamming KNN for every feature family, Euclidean distance in
  `30` diffusion coordinates for seven linkage methods plus neighbor joining,
  then fixed-topology NNLS against squared standardized Euclidean raw-feature
  distance. Reconstructed continuous inputs have off-diagonal Hamming distance
  identically `1`, producing mostly tiny outlier-versus-rest linkage roots;
  this is the primary defect for clear Gaussian/outlier/phylogenetic cases.
  Binary overlap and SBM distances are nondegenerate but have between/within
  distance ratios near one. Across topology methods no sibling gate opens.
  NNLS branch time only multiplies contrast variance, with median root
  multipliers around `1.1`--`1.6`, and a root-only no-branch counterfactual
  still leaves all nine edge-closed cases above `edge_alpha=0.001`. Recorded
  the resulting method direction: family-aware graph distance, aligned branch
  target, and branch-fit admissibility checks before branch lengths affect
  inferential variance.
- Added aligned prepared-geometry support to fixed-topology NNLS and the
  graphtools runner, preserving original observations for TBS tests and all
  existing defaults. Added and ran
  `benchmarks/validation/family_metric_nnls_grid.py` over six representative
  families, eight topology methods, and branch-time off/on (`96` cells, `86`
  successful, `10` fail-closed). The panel gives perfect known-K topology to
  clear Gaussian and balanced binary cases, strong categorical clade recovery,
  a selected average-linkage overlap partition with ARI `0.9148`, poor
  high-dimensional/SBM topology, and zero final partition changes across `43`
  paired branch-time cells. The clear Gaussian failure is now localized after
  topology recovery: sibling p-values remain above threshold and branch-time
  closes the root edge path. Recorded the evidence in
  [[family-metric-nnls-grid-20260709]] and retained explicit `no_promotion`
  status.

### 2026-07-14

- Reviewed the family-geometry, selected-node-law, topology-diagnosis, and
  BranchArchitect comparison changes as one development integration. Pinned
  BranchArchitect at commit `bfa33713d61e74df109990c018436fe4330f2e95`
  through `vendor/BranchArchitect`, added the minimal optional runtime extra,
  made installed and bundled adapter loading explicit, and retained
  fail-closed behavior when neither source is available. The comparison stays
  evidence-only and MIT-licensed; the separate GPL graphtools/tasklogger
  packaging constraint is unchanged.

### 2026-07-27

- Audited repository organization, executable health, Git ancestry, remote
  publication state, release metadata, and retained-evidence volume. Recorded
  that `codex/tree-consensus-validation` is the newest coherent local
  development line but not a published, consolidated, tagged, or
  publication-ready release. Consolidated Pytest configuration, completed the
  ordered test-stage map, added one `make check` health interface, aligned the
  root MIT license with package metadata, excluded the pinned BranchArchitect
  submodule from root lint, and normalized safe first-party import ordering.
  Replaced deprecated Scanpy version access with package metadata. Verified the
  1,245-test suite, Ruff, package build, quick start, and wiki lint; see
  [[repository-hygiene-and-completion-audit-20260727]].
- Reorganized methodological space separation into
  `tree_break_selection/space_separation/`, moved generic plotting backend and
  report-panel primitives into `tree_break_selection/plot/`, and grouped
  endotype/GO, scRNA, and MNIST adapters under `applications/`. Removed copied
  adaptive-cosine, invariant/equivariant, image-panel, naming, and MNIST summary
  logic; a 90%-confidence Vulture scan found no remaining dead code. Recorded
  the resulting interfaces and residual diagnostic redundancy in
  [[method-application-and-plot-seams-20260727]] and
  [[redundant-and-legacy-code-map-20260623]].
- Verified the reorganized repository through `make check`: Ruff and wiki lint
  passed, and all 1,251 tests completed across the seven purpose-ordered stages.
- Completed the responsibility split by moving scRNA-specific audits and
  biological follow-up analyses to `applications/scrna/analysis/`, moving
  Python/R scRNA report composition to `applications/scrna/plots/`, and
  promoting fixed/adaptive diffusion kernels from benchmark runners into the
  main `tree_break_selection/space_separation/` interface.
- Reduced root `scripts/` to maintenance and external-request helpers by moving
  the discrete covariance replay to `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/` and
  the seven explanatory toy/manuscript figure generators to
  `manuscript/tools/figures/`.
- Mapped every live tree-construction route across the registry, runners, core
  tree adapters, endotype, scRNA, MNIST, consensus, bootstrap, and validation
  surfaces. Distinguished geometry, topology, rooting, branch-length fitting,
  and gates; recorded the three registered topology builders, application-only
  linkage routes, residual direct-linkage repetition, two dormant public
  adapters, and non-builders such as BranchArchitect and the consensus
  selector in [[tree-construction-method-map]]. Promoted the remaining fixed
  Hamming-neighbor diffusion engine to the public space-separation interface
  and removed application, experiment, and diagnostic imports of its private
  benchmark-runner implementation.
- Rechecked the complete organization candidate against `dev` and repaired the
  review findings: restored append-only wiki history, reduced `.mex/` to routing
  pointers, corrected the distinct binary-benchmark and PCA50-report MNIST tree
  routes, repaired relocated scRNA plot-manifest entry points, promoted shared
  runner helpers out of private underscore imports, and declared direct
  plotting/application dependencies. `make check` passed Ruff, wiki lint, and
  all 1,252 purpose-ordered tests.
- Confirmed the final organization tree is technically fast-forwardable from
  local and remote `dev` with no source conflict, while keeping the real index
  unchanged. Recorded that `HEAD` must not be merged before the 189-file
  worktree pass is committed, and separated that mechanical result from the
  owner decision over 865 tracked evidence files under `results/`.

### 2026-07-28

- Committed the reviewed organization pass as `b247a1f6` and fast-forwarded
  local `dev` from `8aaa2615` to that commit, preserving the approved tracked
  evidence payload. Reverified the integrated tree with Ruff, wiki lint, all
  1,252 purpose-ordered tests, package builds, quick start, lock resolution,
  and the clean pinned BranchArchitect submodule. The remote `origin/dev` was
  intentionally not pushed and remains at `8aaa2615`.
- Removed the mutable root `tree_break_selection/config.py` module and the
  redundant decomposition config dataclass/module. Tree-construction defaults
  now live with the tree module; traversal options are explicit at method
  boundaries, with no compatibility aliases. Root and plot imports are lazy,
  and ordinary benchmark dispatch requests compact tracing while
  trace-dependent diagnostics retain full traces. Batched
  distributional-action annotation replaced per-edge DataFrame mutation while
  preserving the diagnostic schema. Plot-package initialization now selects
  the file-safe Matplotlib backend before any plotting engine imports
  `pyplot`, preventing the documented macOS AppKit abort in headless runs.
- Reorganized the flat calibration-diagnostic namespace into responsibility
  categories for edges, overlap, roots, selected structures, sibling models,
  spectral transport, statistics, and traversal. Mirrored the same categories
  under `tests/validation/calibration/`, migrated active imports and evidence
  paths without aliases, removed the unreferenced edge diagnostic, and
  consolidated multiscale UMAP rendering on the maintained plotting engine and
  selected-family runner.
- Completed the next hygiene tranche by enforcing the file-safe Matplotlib
  backend at directly executable plotting seams, removing live compatibility
  plot filenames and deprecated CLI aliases, and deleting the obsolete MP
  stacked-row option throughout decomposition, runners, manifests, and tests.
  Reorganized endotype applications, validation programs, and spectral
  diagnostics into responsibility packages with mirrored tests and canonical
  package imports only. Removed unused direct dependencies and refreshed the
  lockfile. Verification passed Ruff, wiki lint, the 171-test focused tranche,
  the 332-test documented quick suite, the end-to-end quick start, and the
  14-case representative benchmark smoke without a native plotting crash.
- Consolidated tree construction into responsibility modules under
  `tree_break_selection/tree/construction/`: explicit method dispatch,
  immutable defaults, hierarchical promotion, and phylogenetic rooting. The
  dispatcher now validates builder/rooting combinations and returns one
  construction-evidence result; method order is explicit and independent of
  directory or import-discovery order. Removed unused sklearn/edge-list
  adapters and shallow `PosetTree.from_*` aliases, migrated live callers to
  direct constructors, preserved non-string linkage labels, and made bottom-up
  traversal deterministic across node insertion order while replacing list
  queues with deques. Deleted the three uncited exploratory notebooks after
  proving they still imported the removed `kl_clustering_analysis` package and
  mutable config surface throughout; no partial compatibility rewrite or alias
  was retained.
- Rebuilt the executable repository map after branch consolidation, covering
  method, application, plotting, tree-construction, and benchmark dependency
  directions in [[repository-execution-and-benchmark-map]]. Re-ran the 14-case
  smoke (`11` successful, `3` fail-closed skips, mean ARI `0.898`), the
  17-case descriptive regression suite (`11` successful, `6` fail-closed
  skips, mean ARI `0.5957`), and 288 focused architecture/benchmark tests.
  Recorded that `regression/run_gate.py` enforces no threshold, skipped rows
  lose stage timings, and repeated fallback `FeatureSpace` construction
  dominates avoidable profiled work.
- Added the missing adaptive-diffusion branch-time comparison on the same
  14-case subset. Fixed-topology NNLS improved mean ARI from `0.5445` to
  `0.8722` and exact-K recovery from `4/13` to `10/13` successful rows without
  changing diffusion geometry or linkage topology, at about 36% wall-time
  overhead. Both variants exposed the same duplicate-row pydiffmap bandwidth
  failure; the audit also records that NNLS timing is omitted from canonical
  CSV rows and the smoke script executes unintentionally on import.
- Audited the adaptive pydiffmap plus fixed-topology NNLS method and its
  numerical-library contracts. Executed checks exposed pydiffmap's hidden
  positive-neighbor minimum, confirmed that raising K does not rescue
  duplicate-heavy zero-bandwidth data, measured weak diffusion/NNLS geometry
  agreement on graph and overlap cases, and found materially seed-sensitive
  sampled edge lengths despite stable labels in three checked cases. Recorded
  solver-termination ambiguity, feature-family mismatch, dense full-spectrum
  scaling, dependency risk, and a correctness-first implementation order in
  [[adaptive-diffusion-nnls-method-library-audit]].
- Compared better diffusion implementations under the same NNLS branch policy.
  Graphtools adaptive K completed all 14 representative cases but remained
  slower, GPL-only, duplicate-warning-prone, and exact-K `8/14`. The
  repository fixed-Hamming kNN route completed all 14, recovered
  `binary_perfect_4c` exactly, reached exact-K `11/14`, mean ARI `0.863`, and
  median ARI `1.0`. Recorded it as the strongest immediate permissive
  implementation and a duplicate-explicit sparse scikit-learn/SciPy kernel
  with partial `eigsh` as the preferred long-term adaptive replacement.
- Mapped diffusion libraries and methods onto the repository's three explicit
  `FeatureSpace` families. Bernoulli data receives binary-metric sparse
  diffusion, categorical data receives block/simplex affinity, and continuous
  data receives Gaussian/manifold diffusion through datafold or Scanpy.
  Separated graph adjacency into direct graph diffusion with PyGSP rather than
  flattening it into independent Bernoulli features; classified PHATE and
  Palantir as trajectory comparators instead of global clustering backends.
- Traced the complete post-diffusion construction path into topology, rooting,
  NNLS edge fitting, typed subtree distributions, gates, and depth-first
  decomposition. Recorded that feature-family awareness begins after topology
  unless the upstream geometry already preserves it; average linkage is a
  baseline rather than a diffusion-native tree estimator; TBS requires a
  binary rooted result; and NNLS changes branch semantics without changing
  topology. Reconciled the seven-case topology-selector evidence with the
  later fail-closed topology-difference diagnosis and passed 15 focused tree
  construction tests.
- Enforced the post-diffusion construction contracts in code. The deep
  `build_tree` interface now rejects malformed condensed distances,
  non-binary rooted trees, leaf mismatches, and invalid branch lengths; MAD
  endpoint roots remain binary through explicit zero-length root edges.
  Natural label ordering, including numeric-aware numbered strings, makes
  exact-tie resolution invariant to input row order without changing existing
  calibration seed behavior, and construction results expose tie and shape
  diagnostics. Replaced
  the four distance-only diffusion functions with one `DiffusionGeometry`
  result interface, removed their old names without aliases, required
  explicit diffusion linkage and NNLS branch geometry, and added
  feature-family/metric validation. Rejected a same-diffusion-coordinate NNLS
  experiment after mean ARI fell to `0.3132`, exact-K to `2/13`, and runtime
  rose to about `29.6` seconds; retained the original-feature dual geometry as
  an explicit reported method contract. The final adaptive NNLS replay retained
  exact-K `10/13`, mean ARI `0.8722`, and median ARI `1.0`; the canonical
  14-case smoke retained exact-K `8/14`, mean ARI `0.898`, and median ARI
  `0.970`. The focused tranche, all 122 core/tree tests, and all 1,260 ordered
  repository tests passed.
- Installed and classified additional diffusion comparison libraries without
  weakening the core numerical interface. PyGSP `0.6.1` is now explicit in
  the `diffusion` extra, deeptime `0.4.5` is isolated in `trajectory`, and
  PHATE `2.0.0` is grouped with graphtools in `experimental-gpl`. Functional
  smokes passed for duplicate-aware neighbors, partial `eigsh`,
  `SpectralEmbedding`, PHATE, PyGSP heat filtering, and deeptime TICA.
  Datafold `2.0.2` was not installed because its resolver plan would downgrade
  NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn, including scikit-learn below the project's
  declared `>=1.3.0` minimum. The synchronized full environment passed package
  compatibility checks, Ruff, wiki lint over 271 pages, and all 1,260 ordered
  repository tests.
- Re-ran the repository duplication audit with independent token-clone,
  normalized-AST, and Pylint similarity checks. Production code contains 384
  weak-mode clone pairs and 7,587 duplicated lines across 400 files (4.14%);
  tests contain 58 pairs and 1,298 duplicated lines across 246 files (2.81%).
  Diagnostic research panels account for 299 production pairs and 6,287 paired
  lines, so the result is not a blanket deletion target. Updated
  [[redundant-and-legacy-code-map-20260623]] with responsibility-based
  ownership, false-positive classes, and a safe cleanup order: plot export,
  TBS runner and gate configuration, core permutation guards, endotype plots,
  validation reporting, then contract-tested diagnostic families.
- Completed the first duplication-cleanup tranche in the benchmark plotting
  engine. Deleted the unused UMAP-only and UMAP-before-tree export interfaces,
  renamed the live workflow to `create_case_report_pages_from_results()`,
  updated its runtime and test callers directly, and kept no aliases. Reused
  the owned figure-output path for the 3D UMAP and manifold engines. This
  removed a net 174 lines from `benchmarks/shared/plots/export.py`; the
  production clone scan fell from 384 to 381 pairs and from 7,587 to 7,489
  duplicated lines. All 20 visualization tests, the complete ordered
  1,260-test repository gate, Ruff, formatting, and wiki lint passed.
- Completed the core duplication and responsibility cleanup. Deleted the
  `_run_tbs_method` registry adapter and `PosetTree.decompose()` facade; all
  callers now expose gate annotation and tree traversal as separate phases.
  `TreeDecomposition` consumes a completed `GateAnnotationBundle` or an
  explicit traversal-decision frame and no longer reconstructs or silently
  recomputes gate configuration. Consolidated the selected-root and
  selected-family permutation loops behind one statistic-driven engine and
  replaced the two child-parent annotation paths with one context-returning
  contract, keeping no aliases. The 10-line/70-token production clone scan
  fell from the post-plot 381 pairs and 7,489 duplicated lines to 373 pairs
  and 7,259 duplicated lines (3.97%). Vulture reported no project-owned dead
  code at 90% confidence; Ruff, wiki lint over 271 pages, focused contract
  suites, and all 1,254 ordered repository tests passed.
- Executed the canonical 121-case, 10-method full benchmark at revision
  `9331319a`. All 1,210 case-method rows were produced: 1,139 were `ok`, 71
  were explicit `skip`, and none had error status. Recorded method coverage,
  common-case and paired diffusion/NNLS comparisons, oracle-K baseline
  ambiguity, 28 canonical-TBS calibration skips, 13 continuous-preset skips,
  and 11 pydiffmap duplicate/support failures in
  `reports/benchmark_execution_audit_20260728.md`; corrected the stale
  110-case count in `benchmarks/README.md`.
- Completed the next repository-hygiene tranche. Corrected the clone map's
  endotype diagnosis: the duplicated block was reference-table and mygene
  mapping logic, not plotting. Moved that responsibility into
  `applications/endotypes/_shared.py` and deleted both copies without aliases.
  Consolidated validation provenance, Wilson intervals, synthetic covariance
  profiles, and p-value summaries behind the existing report-contract seam and
  the new statistics-owned `calibration_support.py`, while preserving exact
  per-program CSV schemas. The production clone scan fell from 373 pairs and
  7,259 duplicated lines to 370 pairs and 7,175 lines; Ruff, Vulture, 50
  focused tests, and all 1,272 ordered repository tests passed.
- Completed the first contract-tested diagnostic-family cleanup. Classified
  benchmark selection, deterministic runtime defaults, and result-directory
  creation now belong to `benchmarks/diagnostics/runner_support.py`; prepared
  tree/gate/traversal/oracle context belongs to `oracle/gate_path_trace.py`;
  sibling-null table preparation and target selection belong to the
  sibling-null `runner_support.py`. Deleted the copied implementations from
  four sibling-null runners and the gate-path runner without aliases. This
  exposed and fixed their copied project-root bug: sibling defaults formerly
  resolved under `benchmarks/diagnostics/benchmarks/...` instead of
  `benchmarks/results/`. The production clone scan fell from 370 pairs and
  7,175 duplicated lines to 353 pairs and 6,542 lines (3.58%). All 45 focused
  oracle/sibling tests and all 1,278 repository tests passed; Ruff, Vulture,
  wiki lint over 271 pages, and five command-interface smokes also passed.

### 2026-07-29

- Removed ten statically proven unused production parameters and their caller
  arguments. Deleted the unconsumed gate leaf-data metadata contract and its
  full-DataFrame SHA-256 work. Removed the impossible distributional-action
  filter configuration without aliases: the statistical module now owns only
  action formulas, while optional annotation enrichment lives under
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/analysis/` and no longer runs during clustering.
  Moved its diagnostic annotation tests out of the statistics suite into the
  matching validation-diagnostics category, and added the previously omitted
  15 endotype application tests to the ordered repository gate. Split the
  ambiguous root `test_methodology_fixes.py` collection into spectral-context,
  projected-Wald reference-law, and sibling-skip contracts under
  `tests/statistics/`; no test logic remains at the suite root. Ruff, Vulture,
  wiki lint over 271 pages, all 1,277 ordered tests, the 14-case smoke benchmark,
  and the 17-row regression gate passed.
- Removed five proven redundant test cases. Deleted the pipeline gate-annotation
  module that was AST-identical to the maintained core contract; deleted three
  lower-level `TreeDecomposition` validation cases already covered through the
  core interface, including one assertion against private state; and folded
  the duplicate support-profile registry contract into the pipeline registry
  test. Removed repeated negative assertions for retired legacy identifiers.
  The ordered gate now contains 1,272 cases. The 12-line/80-token test clone
  scan fell from 53 pairs and 1,175 duplicated lines immediately before this
  tranche to 51 pairs and 1,084 duplicated lines. All 1,272 ordered tests,
  Ruff, and wiki lint over 271 pages passed.
- Added the standalone `tools/repository_audit/` package and globally installed
  its `tbs-audit` interface. The tool isolates Coverage.py, Grimp, mutmut,
  pytest-cov, pytest-deadfixtures, pytest-testmon, Ruff, Semgrep, and Vulture
  behind `map`, `quick`, `evidence`, and explicit `mutation` modes; jscpd is
  installed globally. Its evidence model excludes package initializers from
  study counts, distinguishes imports from standalone execution, traces
  dictionary/DataFrame string fields, and joins documentation and Git history
  before labeling a module unresolved. Added 19 focused tool tests and Make
  targets. The first map found 132 calibration implementation modules, 76
  test-only imports, and 8 statically unimported modules, but zero automatically
  unresolved modules after documentation and entry-point evidence. The quick
  adapter smoke and all 19 tool tests passed.
- Applied the coverage-context evidence to production boundaries. Moved the
  selected-family UMAP renderer from `tree_break_selection/plot/` to its
  diagnostic family, removed its public lazy exports without aliases, and
  moved the calibration-only effective-rank summary from the projection API to
  calibration statistics. Replaced the sibling-gate calibration catch-all with
  exhaustive fixed-subspace, data-independent, selected-tail, empirical-null,
  and degenerate labels; unknown methods now fail explicitly. Calibration-only
  production coverage fell from 79 lines to 2 retained worker-selection
  branches in the live spectral estimator; 21,936 remaining lines are confined
  to benchmark/diagnostic modules. The compact audit deletes raw coverage
  databases. Ruff, 19 audit-tool tests, wiki lint over 272 pages, all 1,290
  purpose-ordered tests, and the 14-case canonical benchmark smoke passed.
- Corrected the quick audit's dead-fixture environment boundary. It previously
  invoked pytest from the isolated audit-tool environment, where application
  dependencies such as `pypdf` were unavailable and a collection error could
  be hidden behind the plugin's successful exit. The adapter now launches the
  repository's locked application environment through `uv run --no-sync` and
  adds only `pytest-deadfixtures` as a transient overlay. The twentieth audit
  tool test protects this command boundary; the corrected quick audit collected
  all fixtures without import errors.
- Applied the first structured clone-removal tranche, filtering
  production/application and benchmark clones separately. Consolidated four
  scRNA R renderers behind one application plotting module for branch display,
  edge-table-to-phylo construction, descendant traversal, cluster branch
  metadata, palettes, root markers, and MRCA audits. Centralized benchmark
  result numeric-column ownership, derived detailed logging from the canonical
  result schema, shared overlap binary threshold scans, shared selected-root
  action-support geometry, and introduced a common diagnostic table/manifest
  writer. No legacy imports or aliases were added. The combined jscpd scan fell
  from 492 clone groups and 8,753 duplicated lines (3.71%) to 473 groups and
  8,178 lines (3.47%); the production/application slice fell from 46 groups and
  831 lines (1.89%) to 35 groups and 507 lines (1.16%), and the benchmark slice
  fell from 361 groups and 6,388 lines (4.43%) to 353 groups and 6,139 lines
  (4.26%). All 1,295 purpose-ordered tests, 20 audit-tool tests, Ruff, R parser
  checks for all four renderers plus the shared module, and wiki lint over 272
  pages passed.
- Continued the benchmark clone cleanup by moving selected-root diagnostic
  value parsing, support-role classification, log-action transforms,
  spectral-excess transforms, root-tail stratum keys, and deformed tail-excess
  lookup to `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/root/root_tail_values.py`.
  Rewired selected-root spectral-tail, action-support, nearest-support,
  deformed-law, validity, conditional-tilt, binary-resolution, H_u
  observability, kernel-tail, population-law, and tie-rank generator/spectral
  lift panels to import from that owner instead of the spectral-tail panel's
  private helpers. The selected spectral-tail and generator-target panels now
  use the common diagnostic table/manifest writer. Removed the duplicate
  method-proof trace-column list by importing the maintained math-trace schema.
  The benchmark jscpd slice fell from 353 groups and 6,139 duplicated lines
  (4.26%) to 345 groups and 5,808 lines (4.03%). The selected-root and tie-rank
  validation subsets, focused spectral/generator/reporting tests, math-trace
  inference test, targeted Ruff checks, and import checks passed.
- Removed the duplicated overlap branch-incidence/structural-sibling runner
  mechanics by adding `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/overlap/panel_runner.py`.
  The helper owns supported-case filtering, replicate/data-role iteration,
  one-case binary-template TBS execution, node-row collection, rows/summary
  output, and manifest envelopes; each panel still owns its analytical row
  builder, relevant-node filter, and summary semantics. The benchmark jscpd
  slice fell from 345 groups and 5,808 duplicated lines (4.03%) to 339 groups
  and 5,671 lines (3.94%). The two overlap validation panels, targeted Ruff
  checks, and compile checks passed.
- Added a static field/function lineage mode to `tbs-audit` using LibCST for
  lossless Python source parsing and NetworkX GraphML export. The mode records
  field writer scopes, reader scopes, schema declarations, surfaces, and
  no-reader production candidates for pandas/dictionary cleanup. OpenLineage
  remains documented as runtime job/dataset/run lineage only, not as the static
  source cleanup adapter. A detailed inspection of the first report exposed
  missed pandas `.loc` and field-helper reads, so the LibCST adapter now traces
  multi-slice subscripts and project field-access helpers before classifying
  no-reader candidates. A later detailed pass added the benchmark
  `_annotation_float`, `_annotation_bool`, `_annotation_int`, and
  `_annotation_str` helper readers, reducing generic selected-permutation
  false positives from the production no-reader set.
- Removed 12 production empirical-null support/diagnostic metadata keys from
  `CalibrationDecision.support` and descriptive strata after field-lineage
  review showed they were output-only mirrors rather than decision inputs:
  dropped context axes, family/local weight diagnostics, family strict-null and
  edge-blocked counts, and seven `support_threshold_*` threshold-value mirrors.
  The retained support contract still records the actual decision inputs,
  effective sample sizes, max-weight and leave-one-record diagnostics, contract
  status, and failure reasons. Regenerating `tbs-audit --mode fields` reduced
  total no-reader candidates from 207 to 195 and production no-reader
  candidates from 31 to 19 with zero parse errors.
- Before broad non-production field cleanup, ran the benchmark quality checks:
  integration benchmark smoke tests, the fixed regression gate, and the quick
  subset benchmark. The current regression-gate output was row-identical to the
  stored `benchmarks/results/regression_gate_20260729_070310Z` comparison:
  17 rows, 11 ok, 6 skip, mean ARI `0.595706`, median ARI `0.680293`, exact-K
  `4/17`. The quick subset reported exact-K `8/14`, mean ARI `0.898`, and
  median ARI `0.970`.
- Deepened `tbs-audit --mode fields` by separating raw LibCST read/write reuse
  from cleanup classification. The audit now classifies graph attributes,
  environment keys, configuration keys, and output-schema/dict-literal columns
  separately from true dead-write candidates. Regenerated field lineage now
  reports 8,216 fields, 144 raw no-reader candidates, 139 cleanup candidates
  after filtering, 9 production raw no-reader candidates, and 6 production
  cleanup candidates; graph keys such as `weight`, `linkage_branch_length`, and
  `branch_length_optimization` are excluded from pandas cleanup.
- Removed the 6 remaining production cleanup candidates from root guard output:
  root-only selected-permutation observed/null/seed/replicate mirrors and the
  root-stability threshold mirror. Regenerated field lineage now reports 8,210
  fields, 138 raw no-reader candidates, 133 cleanup candidates after filtering,
  3 production raw no-reader candidates, and 0 production cleanup candidates;
  the remaining production raw candidates are graph keys.
- Hardened fixed-topology NNLS branch-length optimization in
  `tree_break_selection/tree/optimized_branch_lengths.py`. The fitter now
  records sparse design diagnostics, residual ratios, and whether fitted
  lengths were actually applied to the `PosetTree`; non-converged solver output
  no longer mutates edge branch lengths unless
  `branch_length_optimization_apply_nonconverged=True` is explicitly forwarded.
  Added tests for fail-closed mutation, explicit non-converged application, and
  dense `scipy.optimize.nnls` comparator parity on tiny leaf-pair distances.
- Updated benchmark handling for the hardened NNLS contract. The shared TBS
  runner now refuses to continue an NNLS benchmark row when the fitter did not
  apply branch lengths, preventing rows labeled NNLS branch-time from using
  topology-only/linkage placeholder branch lengths. The family-metric NNLS grid
  now exports solver status, applied/non-converged flags, sparse design
  diagnostics, and normalized residual columns. The quick smoke subset still
  reports exact-K `8/14`, mean ARI `0.898`, and median ARI `0.970`.
- Added strict benchmark execution hardening. Dispatch and per-method execution
  re-raise method exceptions instead of treating them as benchmark skip rows.
  Strict regression immediately exposes the existing TBS empirical-null
  calibration failure instead of recording it as a skip row. Remaining shared
  benchmark string-boolean parameters now use strict parsing, and invalid
  explicit support-role metadata fails closed.
- Removed maintained production/benchmark fallback paths. Method dispatch and
  per-method execution no longer convert exceptions into skip rows; regression
  and the family-metric NNLS grid no longer expose tolerant CLI modes. Linkage
  construction no longer builds topology-only placeholder branch lengths for
  non-monotone heights, branch-length neighborhood distances no longer impute
  missing edge lengths, mixed-type sample labels no longer sort via
  type/`repr`, disconnected stopping-edge distances no longer map to infinity,
  and external selected-tail calibration rescue was removed from the production
  sibling empirical-null seam.
- Removed live alias/legacy surfaces from maintained code. Root package,
  plotting package, and `benchmarks.shared.util` no longer provide lazy
  compatibility-style attribute exports; callers and tests use direct
  purpose-specific module imports. Remaining legacy wording in production
  docstrings was replaced with current-method terminology, and the repository
  audit import scanner no longer uses `alias` as a variable name for AST import
  entries.
- Rechecked alias/legacy surfaces across maintained code and applications.
  Removed stale scRNA plot-manifest alias failure statuses, renamed the
  path-conditioned diagnostic `tbs_current` relation from alias to replicate,
  and removed non-method deprecation wording from the scRNA distributional-action
  audit warning filter. A full Python scan now leaves only vendor
  BranchArchitect compatibility terms, wiki-schema/test policy wording, and
  diagnostic metric-compatibility terminology outside maintained TBS aliases.
- Removed doubled probability-validation and grouped-categorical simplex
  covariance setup inside the production contrast-covariance module. Bernoulli
  and categorical tangent checks now share one probability-input validator, and
  grouped categorical Wald/tangent whitening share contrast-slice and Cholesky
  construction helpers.
- Removed the next statically proven dead parameters from maintained
  application, benchmark, and validation code. The cleanup eliminated unused
  endotype report/plot parameters, scRNA diagnostic/report helper parameters,
  the random-feature coverage width argument, the dead inner benchmark
  `strict` pass-through after fail-loud execution hardening, and an unused
  BranchArchitect split-length root argument.
- Ran a non-canonical full-suite benchmark sweep excluding the TBS-family
  methods after the fail-loud empirical-null calibration abort. The run used
  `TBS_METHODS=leiden,louvain,kmeans,spectral,dbscan,optics,hdbscan` and
  `TBS_ENABLE_PLOTS=0`, completed all 121 cases with 847/847 ok rows, and wrote
  results under
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260729_noncanonical_no_tbs_full/`. Mean ARI ranked
  k-means `0.864`, spectral `0.837`, Leiden `0.816`, Louvain `0.812`, HDBSCAN
  `0.601`, DBSCAN `0.573`, and OPTICS `0.524`, confirming the non-TBS default
  methods run through the cleaned benchmark stack.
- Fixed the TBS empirical-null calibration blocker exposed by
  `gauss_extreme_noise_highd`. When a sibling gate has selected focal tests but
  no internal empirical-null support records, annotation now fails closed with
  explicit `empirical_null_no_internal_support` metadata instead of raising
  during full benchmark execution.
- Hardened diffusion benchmark execution around library limitations. Adaptive
  pydiffmap neighbor resolution now accounts for exact duplicate rows, and
  pydiffmap variable-bandwidth methods explicitly skip duplicate blocks that
  would trigger zero local bandwidths. Hamming-diffusion methods also skip
  continuous feature spaces with recorded compatibility reasons rather than
  silently falling through.
- Reran the canonical full benchmark with plots disabled after calibration and
  diffusion hardening. The run completed all 121 cases and wrote results under
  `benchmarks/results/run_20260729_canonical_full_maxiter1000_no_plots/`.
  Status counts were 1176 ok rows, 34 explicit skips, and 0 failures across
  1210 method-case rows. Mean ARI on ok rows ranked k-means `0.864`, spectral
  `0.837`, Leiden `0.816`, Louvain `0.812`, adaptive-diffusion NNLS `0.773`,
  TBS `0.612`, HDBSCAN `0.601`, DBSCAN `0.573`, OPTICS `0.524`, and fixed
  Hamming diffusion TBS `0.483`.
- Modularized maintained benchmark orchestration. Added
  `benchmarks/shared/benchmark_runs/` for runtime defaults, resume/grid
  coverage, smoke-suite selection and summaries, and regression-gate execution.
  Added `benchmarks/continuous/run.py` as a continuously runnable local/CI
  benchmark gate that reuses the regression-gate seam instead of duplicating
  benchmark logic. Existing full, smoke, and regression entrypoints now delegate
  to the shared run modules while preserving their command names.
- Simplified the regression-style benchmark gate CLI seam after modularization.
  `benchmarks/continuous/run.py` and `benchmarks/regression/run_gate.py` now
  share `benchmarks/shared/benchmark_runs/regression_gate_cli.py`, keeping both
  command adapters thin while preserving their distinct help text and completion
  labels.
- Removed production endotype duplicate groups. Shared endotype helpers now
  cover binary feature-matrix loading, Benjamini-Hochberg correction,
  subspace/tree CLI arguments, spectral-block record fields, report artifact
  index loading, method/tree run summary recording, tree-analysis command
  construction, embedding figure layout, rendered artifact path metadata, and
  KAK candidate-summary loading. The focused `applications` clone scan dropped
  to 17 exact groups / 246 duplicated lines / 0.95%, with remaining groups in
  `mnist/` and `scrna/` application code rather than `endotypes/`.
- Removed high-confidence scRNA plotting/report duplicate groups. Shared scRNA
  plotting helpers now cover static artifact provenance records, cluster-size
  bars, selected NNLS radial page construction, selected-tree coordinate
  assignment, R tree-renderer setup, pancreas method/edge maps, pancreas
  tip-data construction, cluster MRCA lookup, and repeated Goncalves UMAP panel
  styling. The focused `applications/scrna` clone scan dropped to 8 exact
  groups / 90 duplicated lines / 0.83%; the full `applications` scan dropped to
  9 exact groups / 112 duplicated lines / 0.43%.
- Removed the remaining MNIST plotting duplicate by moving digit colors and
  alpha/assignment-key helpers into `applications/mnist/_shared.py`. The full
  `applications` clone scan dropped to 8 exact groups / 90 duplicated lines /
  0.35%; remaining groups are scRNA analysis logic plus tiny R renderer
  bootstrap blocks.
- Removed the next scRNA analysis duplicate tranche. Static artifact provenance
  is now shared through `applications/scrna/_shared.py` across scRNA audit and
  plotting report code, and the pancreas inner-node review builders now share
  their internal tree-review input/setup seam. The full `applications` clone
  scan dropped to 6 exact groups / 63 duplicated lines / 0.24%.
- Added a dedicated duplicate-cleanup mode to the repository hygiene tool.
  `tbs-audit --mode duplicates --scope applications` now runs jscpd, classifies
  clone groups by cleanup purpose/risk, and writes JSON plus Markdown reports
  under `reports/audits/generated/duplicate-cleanup.*`. The global
  `/Users/berksakalli/.local/bin/tbs-audit` entrypoint exposes the mode, so it
  is reachable from other worktrees via `--repo /path/to/repo`.

### 2026-07-30

- Generated the all-method topology/diffusion PDF-CDF and p-value audit under
  `reports/audits/generated/all_topology_spectral_pdf_cdf_relationships/`.
  The audit covered 18 successful construction/diffusion/branch-source groups,
  found raw sibling projected-Wald statistics best fit by scaled chi-square,
  exponential, or gamma families rather than plain fixed-subspace chi-square,
  and recorded the selected-quadratic-form interpretation in
  [[topology-diffusion-pdf-cdf-spectral-relationship-audit-20260730]].
- Traced `n_calibration` through Tree-BH, sibling-record construction, and the
  empirical-null fit. Blocked descendants had been reported simultaneously as
  strict-null and stopped-edge records because untested edges retain
  `rejected=False`. Production reporting now makes these roles exclusive while
  preserving the validated all-descendant inflation estimate. On
  `binary_moderate_4c`, the unchanged 75-record fit is now reported as 4 tested
  null records plus 71 blocked records; it retains four clusters, ARI `1.0`,
  and `c_hat=15.0933`.
- Added `tbs-audit --mode calibration-contract --calibration-records PATH`.
  Across the 48,114 exported all-method sibling rows it found 25,960
  role-supported node records but only 4,862 tested-null plus stopped-frontier
  structural records, including 21,098 nested blocked descendants. The report
  exposes this dependence diagnostic without silently changing production
  weighting; a frontier-only trial was rejected after it changed the binary
  low/moderate/hard results from 7/4/4 clusters to 10/5/32 clusters.

### 2026-08-01

- Removed the feature-partition calibration direction from the maintained
  repository. Deleted its diagnostic runner, dedicated benchmark artifacts,
  and wiki source page; removed its active code, method-description, report,
  wiki-index, analysis, question, and source references. Same-data
  selection-conditioned calibration remains the sole maintained direction.

### 2026-08-03

- Implemented the typed benchmark outcome contract for scientifically
  unsupported empirical-null TBS runs. Zero-support sibling-calibration
  boundaries now return no labels, zero clusters, a stable structured reason,
  and `NaN` quality metrics; dispatch, result rows, performance grids, coverage
  summaries, and validation plots preserve the distinction from operational
  skips. Mixed calibration states with other role-supported records remain
  executable.
- Replaced the active misleading `gauss_extreme_noise_highd` identifier with
  `gauss_dense_signal_highd` without an alias, and added the distinct
  `gauss_sparse_signal_highd_noise` case with 12 informative plus 19,988
  independent nuisance dimensions. Zero-correlated nuisance sampling now uses
  a linear-memory direct-normal path. Historical raw result identifiers were
  not rewritten.
- Verified 1,363 repository tests with zero failures and 15 numerical warnings,
  broad Ruff checks, 272-page wiki lint, and diff whitespace checks. The fresh
  geometry audit measured nearest-neighbor label agreement of `1.000` for the
  dense case and `0.175` for the sparse case, correctly marking the latter as
  low-signal. A four-row continuation smoke produced one unsupported TBS row,
  three later successful rows, and TBS unsupported coverage `1/2` while
  K-means remained `0/2` unsupported.
- Ran the globally installed repository analysis before commit. `tbs-audit
  --mode quick` scanned 833 Python files with zero parse errors and zero
  unresolved calibration imports; Ruff, Vulture, jscpd execution, and
  dead-fixture checks all completed successfully. The evidence inventory records
  438 exact clone groups and 147 filtered field-cleanup candidates for later
  review rather than treating them as automatic deletions. The generator mode
  completed across all 122 active cases and retained the sparse high-dimensional
  case as an explicit low-geometry-signal stress.
- Removed three proven benchmark-only dead fields: two unused selected-tail
  transforms and the unused complement of the model table's `signal_label`.
  Centralized the duplicated binary child/edge/sibling test identities in
  `TreeDecomposition`. Extended and versioned `tbs-audit` field lineage to
  recognize pandas exports, dictionary iteration, expanded `**kwargs`,
  `DataFrame.attrs`, AnnData `.uns`, and Matplotlib `rcParams`. The fresh scan
  reduced duplicate evidence from 438 to 437 groups and filtered field-cleanup
  candidates from 147 to 130, with zero production cleanup candidates.
- Split the CLI/entrypoint clone inventory into parser, persistence, and
  terminal-rendering responsibilities. Centralized 19 root diagnostic bundle
  writers and 55 calibration output-path printers, then moved identical
  calibration, selected-root, root tie-rank, selected-hierarchy, and traversal
  argument contracts into family-owned `cli.py` modules without forwarding
  aliases. Characterization tests preserve option names, types, defaults, and
  explicit overrides. The global clone scan moved from 437 groups and 7,394
  lines to 409 groups and 6,797 lines; parser-containing groups moved from 62
  and 1,197 lines to 52 and 903 lines.
- Consolidated root-calibration column validation, finite/string value parsing,
  observed-target classification, and diagnostic JSON serialization across six
  selected-root and tie-rank panels. The panels now call the maintained helpers
  in `root_tail_values.py` and `reporting.py` directly while preserving manifest
  ordering and schemas. Focused validation passed 25 tests, and the global clone
  scan moved from 409 groups and 6,797 lines to 402 groups and 6,603 lines.

### 2026-08-04

- Retired the executable fixed c2ef cosine-band coherence comparator and its
  dedicated validation suite. The active diagnostics index no longer exposes
  that legacy entrypoint. Its raw captures and wiki source summary remain as
  historical evidence only; no production or maintained diagnostic path imports
  it.
- Ran `tbs-audit --mode evidence` plus `fields` and `duplicates`, then removed
  the dead code it proved. Deleted two fully unreferenced modules,
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/math_trace/metamorphic_checks.py` and
  `benchmarks/shared/cases/real_data.py`, and 18 unreferenced functions and
  constants across `tree_break_selection`, `benchmarks`, `applications`, and
  `tests`. Removing `PosetTree.find_lca` cascaded to `_get_depths` and the
  `_depths` cache; `find_lca_for_set` stays because MNIST plotting and the
  poset-tree tests still call it. Net 309 deletions against 3 insertions.
- Kept the vulture candidates that static reachability cannot resolve: the six
  `_run_*_method` benchmark runners and `_can_split` are reached through
  name-string registries, the `tests/conftest.py` hooks are invoked by pytest,
  and `epsilon_fitted`/`MAX_IMAGE_PIXELS` are writes onto third-party objects.
- Confirmed the 130 filtered field-cleanup candidates remain false positives for
  benchmark surfaces. The 16 flagged writes in
  `overlap_context_negative_topology_conditioning.py` are listed in
  `DERIVED_NUMERIC_METRICS`, so they reach `ROW_COLUMNS` and the exported CSV;
  the tracer does not read bare string literals in module-level tuples.
  Production cleanup candidates stay at zero.
- Reviewed all three high-risk production-to-production clone groups and made no
  change. The `orchestrator.py` and `contrast_covariance.py` pairs duplicate
  explicit keyword signatures whose shared logic already lives in
  `_resolve_contrast_inputs`, and `SpectralContext`/`SpectralDecompositionResult`
  duplicate field lists across a deliberate projection-to-gate layer boundary.
- Repaired a stale reference left by the in-flight scRNA refactor:
  `goncalves_benchmark.py` still imported the deleted
  `pancreas_benchmark._json_default` after it moved to `_shared.json_default`.
  That single broken import was failing three pipeline tests.
- Closed a scope gap in `tbs-audit`: its import-reachability check only covers
  `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration`, so 297 of 443 modules had never been
  checked. Re-applying the tool's own disposition logic repo-wide returned zero
  `unresolved_unimported` modules. The five suspicious candidates are all live:
  `louvain_runner`, `spectral_runner`, and `optics_runner` are registered by
  module-path string in `method_registry.py`, and the two `benchmarks/external/`
  adapters are documented in `benchmarks/external/README.md`, a path the audit's
  evidence scan does not read.
- Ruff runs only `select = ["E", "F", "I"]`, so the dead-code rule families had
  never executed. Scanning with `--extend-select` found and removed 18 inert
  `noqa` directives (ten suppressing non-selected `BLE001`, one suppressing
  already-ignored `E402`) and 11 unused loop-control bindings across eight
  files. Two flagged items were kept as false positives: `iterations` in
  `oracle_tree_recoverability.py` leaks deliberately and is read after the loop
  as `dinkelbach_iterations`, and `method_registry.py:120` is prose, not code.

### Root selective-permutation guard scope audit

Audited every guard layer in `decomposition/gates/`. Removed one redundant
dispatch arm in `guards.py`: the `scope_value == "root"` branch called
`_selective_guard_root_candidate(out, root, root)` with the same arguments as
the `else` branch and produced the same `[root]` or `[]` result. The predicate
is a pure two-read boolean, so deleting the arm is behavior-preserving; the
`else` branch already handles the `root` scope, which
`fixed_coordinate_selective_root_v1` exercises with 99 replicates.

Two guard scopes are reachable only from tests and were **deliberately kept**:

| Scope | Sole enabling profile | Why it is retained |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `open_internal` | `fixed_coordinate_selective_traversal_v1` | Closes the pass-through null leak but is too conservative for signal: binary signal mean ARI `0.651330`, categorical `0.521072`. Superseded by `fixed_coordinate_selective_passthrough_v1`. |
| `global_sibling_min_passthrough_descendant` | `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_v1` | Still shows boundary false splits. Superseded by `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1`. |

Neither profile is a default and no module outside `profiles.py` selects
either one, so static reachability reports both as dead. They are not: the wiki
cites their measured results as the evidence for choosing the profiles that do
run, so removing them would delete the justification for the current gate
configuration. Treat a future "unused guard scope" report on these two as
expected, not as a cleanup target.

All other guard machinery is live. Every guard helper has call sites beyond its
definition, `root_stability_guard_threshold` is set by all profiles, and
`spectral_transport_passthrough_guard` is enabled by two profiles that
production paths select.

### Retired overlapping benchmark cases

Removed seven commented-out binary overlap case definitions from
`benchmarks/shared/cases/overlapping.py` (401 to 324 lines). All were disabled
for runtime cost, not for scientific invalidity, so their parameters are
recorded here as the durable provenance:

| Case | Samples x features | Clusters | Entropy | Balanced | Seed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `overlap_extreme_6c_highd` | 600 x 1000 | 6 | 0.45 | yes | 8004 |
| `overlap_mod_10c_highd` | 1000 x 800 | 10 | 0.32 | yes | 8103 |
| `overlap_part_10c_highd` | 1000 x 600 | 10 | 0.23 | yes | 8203 |
| `overlap_hd_6c_2k` | 600 x 2000 | 6 | 0.33 | yes | 8301 |
| `overlap_hd_8c_3k` | 800 x 3000 | 8 | 0.30 | yes | 8302 |
| `overlap_hd_10c_5k` | 1000 x 5000 | 10 | 0.28 | yes | 8303 |
| `overlap_unbal_10c_highd` | 1000 x 1000 | 10 | 0.28 | no | 8403 |

All seven use `generator: binary` with `feature_sparsity: 0.05`. The active case
counts are unchanged: four heavy, three moderate, three partial, one
high-dimensional, three unbalanced binary groups, plus eight Gaussian and three
Gaussian-quantile cases.

### 2026-08-07

Repository-wide documentation, legacy, and dead-code audit. Ruff, `wiki-lint`
(272 pages), the ordered suite, `tools/repository_audit`, and `tbs-audit --mode
quick` all passed before and after. No new dead code: vulture silent, no dead
fixtures, no unused imports or locals, zero import cycles across the 125 package
modules, and the only two extended-ruff findings are the 2026-08-04 false
positives. The GitHub wiki remote returns `Repository not found` while the main
remote resolves, so in-repo `wiki/` is the only wiki surface.

- Fixed four surfaces that documented things which do not exist.
  `benchmarks/README.md` section 9 described `benchmarks/calibration/`, removed
  by `69225de9`, plus `TBS_CAL_NULL_REPS`, `TBS_CAL_TREEBH_REPS`,
  `calibration_plots.pdf`, and `calibration_report.md` — none of which occur
  anywhere else in the repository. `tests/README.md` claimed 1,272 collected
  cases against a measured 1,367. `notebooks/` was still a path policy and a
  ruff/deptry exclusion after `4a502615` emptied it. `wiki/maintenance.md` told
  maintainers to promote pages from `wiki/candidates/`, which has no history in
  this repository and is absent from the `AGENTS.md` layout and [[schema]].
  Also named the `audit-test` stage that `make check` runs but `README.md`
  omitted.
- Added `test_spectral_context_mirrors_every_decomposition_field`. The
  `SpectralContext`/`SpectralDecompositionResult` split kept on 2026-08-04 had
  nothing protecting its 12-field hand-written forwarding, where a dropped
  field silently defaults to `{}`. Mutation check: with one field dropped the
  other seven tests in that file still passed. The test iterates
  `dataclasses.fields`, so future fields are covered.
- Two gaps left open: `selected_quadratic_law_audit.py` is the only calibration
  diagnostic with no wiki record, and `[tool.deptry]` configures a tool that no
  dependency group installs and no command invokes.

### Second bloat pass below the configured thresholds

The first pass used the repository's own audit thresholds and found the
repository clean. Re-running the same signals at lower thresholds found the
duplication those thresholds sit above.

- **Correction to the 2026-08-04 entry.** It recorded that "the six
  `_run_*_method` benchmark runners and `_can_split` are reached through
  name-string registries." That is true for all six runners — each has an
  `_import_runner(..., "_run_*_method")` string in `method_registry.py`, checked
  individually. It is **not** true for `GateEvaluator._can_split`:
  `method_registry.py` never names it, `rg 'self\._can_split\('` returns
  nothing, `GateEvaluator` is never subclassed, and the only other repository
  hit is an unrelated tuple-unpacking local in `gate_path_trace.py:348`. Its
  body was also already inlined in `_compute_can_split_by_node`. Removed; the
  full suite still passes 1,368. Re-running vulture afterwards surfaced
  `passthrough_support_status`, which is live via
  `tests/localization/35_test_gates_traversal.py:351`, so the cascade stops
  there.
- **jscpd at 5 lines / 40 tokens reports 7.01% duplication (1,191 clones,
  12,893 lines), against 2.66% at the configured 8 lines / 70 tokens.** This
  repository's duplication is mostly 6-to-8-line scalar helpers, which sit just
  under the configured floor. An AST scan with docstrings stripped and names
  normalized finds 67 duplicate function groups worth 1,114 redundant lines.
- **The canonical helpers exist and are bypassed.** `reporting.py` owns
  `diagnostic_json_default`: 2 modules import it, 20 declare their own
  `_json_default`. `root/root_tail_values.py` owns `finite_float` and
  `string_value`, which the calibration README already names as the shared
  owner: 31 modules declare `_finite_float`, 17 declare `_string_value`, 17
  declare `_bool_value`. The two `_string_value` variants differ only in one
  type annotation, and the canonical version is otherwise byte-identical, so
  this is copying rather than divergence. Consolidation is safe in principle but
  spans 31 files and is left for a dedicated patch.
- **Repository weight is the largest untracked issue.** `.git` is 1.8 GB and
  tracked content is 1.74 GB, of which all source is about 11 MB. `results/` has
  been ignored by `.gitignore:102` since 2026-02-13, yet 865 files and 211 MB
  under `results/analyses/aml_michel_...20260623_151556/` were force-added on
  2026-06-23 by `c74e3e15`, and that run directory is cited by no wiki, doc,
  report, or manuscript file. Separately, `docs/onboarding.md:73` calls
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/` "small promoted evidence snapshots" while it
  holds 191 files over 1 MB totalling 978 MB, including single 71 MB and 67 MB
  CSVs. The citation discipline itself holds: 94 of 120 promoted top-level
  entries are cited. There is no `.gitattributes` and no Git LFS.
- Smaller items recorded for later: `_capture_runner` is defined 10 times in
  `tests/pipeline/51_test_dispatch_contract.py` (222 redundant lines across 9
  within-file test groups); `benchmarks/cloud/` triplicates
  `validate_shard_contract`, `_validate_replicate_coverage`, `current_git_state`,
  and `main`; and the `all` extra hand-duplicates 28 dependency specs from eight
  other extras with no test keeping them in sync. Excluding `graphtools` and
  `phate` from `all` is a documented GPL boundary, but excluding `biopython` and
  `orjson` is not explained anywhere.

### Scalar-helper consolidation and the dead AML result set

**Correction to the bloat pass above.** It reported the duplicated helpers as
"copying, not divergence" on the strength of two `_string_value` variants. That
generalisation was wrong. Comparing every copy against the canonical body:

| Local helper | Copies | Match canonical | Distinct bodies |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `_finite_float` | 28 | 26 | 7 |
| `_string_value` / `string_value` | 16 | 15 | 3 |
| `_json_default` | 20 | **0** | **10** |
| `_require_columns` | 22 | **0** | 7 |
| `_bool_value` | 17 | n/a (no canonical) | 8 |

Only the first two families are safe to merge. The `_json_default` copies
genuinely differ: nine omit the canonical dataclass branch, two add
`np.ndarray -> tolist()`, one replaces the `TypeError` with a `str(value)`
fallback, and two hand-roll a dataclass branch for one specific config class.
Merging them would change serialization behaviour, so they are left alone;
`_require_columns` and `_bool_value` likewise need per-family review.

- Added `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/values.py` holding `finite_float`
  and `string_value`, moved from `root/root_tail_values.py`, which now imports
  them and keeps its `__all__` so its 22 importers are unaffected. The generic
  coercers sit at the package root because `overlap/`, `selected/`,
  `statistics/`, and `traversal/` all need them and should not import from the
  `root/` category.
- Removed 41 provably equivalent local definitions across 30 files. Equivalence
  was checked on unparsed source, not by eye: alpha-renamed locals,
  `float('nan')` for `math.nan`, and a redundant `value is None` guard all
  reduce to the canonical body. The two `_finite_float` copies that delegate to
  a local `_is_finite` or use `pd.to_numeric(errors='coerce')`, and the one
  `_string_value` that restructures its guard, were left in place.
- Effect: the AST duplicate scan falls from 67 groups / 1,114 redundant lines to
  63 / 878; jscpd at 5 lines / 40 tokens falls from 7.01% to 6.87%. The
  remaining duplication is the `_json_default`, `_require_columns`, and
  `_bool_value` families plus the panel run/report mechanics.
- Untracked the dead AML result set. `results/` has been ignored by
  `.gitignore:102` since 2026-02-13, yet 865 files and about 211 MB were
  force-added on 2026-06-23 by `c74e3e15`, and no wiki page, doc, report,
  manuscript, manifest, or test names that run directory. `git rm -r --cached
  results` drops it from the index; the working tree is untouched, so the
  `results/analyses` scan in `inventory_go_annotation_datasets.py` still sees
  local runs, and history still holds every byte. Tracked content falls from
  1.74 GB to 1.49 GB. **This does not shrink `.git`, which stays at 1.8 GB;
  only a history rewrite would.** If the AML analysis should stay citable, the
  repository's own pattern is to promote a curated subset into `raw/assets/`
  and give it a `wiki/sources/` page.
- `docs/onboarding.md` called `raw/assets/benchmark-results/` "small promoted
  evidence snapshots". It is about 1.13 GiB across 120 top-level entries (100
  directories and 20 files), and is the reason a clone is large. Corrected to
  say so.

### Dead-fallback audit

`README.md` states that unsupported statistical contexts fail closed and never
take a neutral fallback. Audited that contract structurally.

**The production contract holds.** No handler anywhere in `tree_break_selection/`
swallows an exception or returns a neutral value. The `.get(key, 0)` defaults in
`empirical_null_inflation_estimation.py` fail closed by construction: a missing
support key reads as `0`, which is below every
`CalibrationSupportThresholds` floor and therefore appends a support failure.
Four structural checks across all five source roots also came back empty:
no statement after an unconditional `return`/`raise`/`continue`/`break`, no
repeated condition in an `if`/`elif` chain, no `except` handler shadowed by an
earlier broader one, and no `sys.version_info` guard (`requires-python` is
already `>=3.11`).

Removed three unreachable fallbacks:

- `kak_lens_alpha_sweep.py:543` and `adaptive_cosine_kak_diffusion_matrix_probe.py:242`
  wrapped `import matplotlib.pyplot` in `except ImportError: return`. Matplotlib
  is a base dependency, and both modules already call
  `configure_matplotlib_backend()` at module scope, which imports it — so the
  module cannot load without matplotlib and the handler cannot run. Had it run,
  a function named `write_plots` would have silently written nothing. The other
  52 files that import `pyplot` use no guard.
- `overlap_conditional_topology_law_panel.py:717` read
  `parent = "" if parent_id is None else str(parent_id)` for a parameter
  annotated `str = ""`. All four call sites pass a string or omit it; the
  production caller passes `string_value(...)`, which is total over `str`.

Corrected two annotations that were lying rather than dead. In
`tree_topology_difference_diagnosis.py`, `_subtree_case_summary` and
`_top_subtree_summary` both annotate `pd.DataFrame` and guard `is None`, but
their only caller declares `subtree_support`/`subtree_highlights` as
`pd.DataFrame | None = None` and forwards them unchanged. The guards are live;
the signatures were wrong, and are now `pd.DataFrame | None`.

Left in place with reasons: the fourteen `except ImportError` guards over
optional extras (`skbio`, `graphtools`, `umap`, `bokeh`, `pypdf`, `PIL`,
`requests`, `brancharchitect`); the `plotly` guard in
`mnist/run_higher_categories.py:653`, which bundles the genuinely optional
`umap` and reports the skip instead of returning silently; and
`_annotation_value`'s `annotations is None` guard in
`overlap_branch_incidence_junction_panel.py:333`, because line 432 builds its
argument with `result.extra.get("annotations", tree.annotations_df)` and a
stored `None` could reach it. The three broad `except Exception: continue`
handlers are also retained: the bootstrap loop in `relationship_analysis.py:1930`
converts dropped draws into `nan` through its `min_success` check, and the other
two scan arbitrary local result directories where a malformed CSV must not abort
an inventory. Narrowing those exception types is worth doing but changes
behaviour, so it is not part of this pass.

### 2026-08-08

#### Dispatch test-fixture consolidation

Replaced 13 repeated `_capture_runner` definitions in
`tests/pipeline/51_test_dispatch_contract.py` with three small module-level test
helpers: one constructs the common successful `MethodRunResult`, one captures a
single runner call, and one appends repeated calls. The three observed capture
behaviours remain distinct. This removes 111 net lines while retaining all 30
dispatch-contract tests. This corrects the 2026-08-07 inventory note, which
counted only 10 of the 13 local definitions.

#### Test-suite dead-gate and fixture cleanup

Removed two migration-only tests whose subjects no longer exist:
`test_runtime_config_modules_are_removed` guarded two deleted configuration
modules, and `test_removed_plot_kwargs_raise_type_error` guarded two deleted
benchmark keyword arguments. Exact search found no live implementation or
consumer for those modules or arguments, and history identifies both tests as
post-removal gates rather than behavioural requirements. Removed four related
absence assertions for retired benchmark dimensions and case identifiers while
retaining the surrounding positive generator and replacement-case contracts.

Consolidated repeated local test doubles without deleting their callers or
assertions: five stable-root stubs and ten selected-root stubs in
`31_test_registry_config_wiring.py`, four successful method-result runners in
`52_test_method_execution_index_alignment.py`, and two queue classes plus their
common successful result construction in
`60_test_case_execution_pdf_cover_mode.py`. Together with the dispatch cleanup,
the test tree loses 218 net lines and only the two dead-gate tests; the live
suite moves from 1,368 to 1,366 collected tests.

Retained the one runtime R skip because it covers a supported optional runtime.
Also retained the two syntactically identical repository-root tests: they read
different module constants, so either relocated command can regress
independently. Negative tests for live statistical parameters, fail-closed
outcomes, and method-registration policy remain live boundary contracts rather
than deletion-history gates.

#### Completed agent-plan cleanup

Deleted four unreferenced execution plans under `docs/superpowers/plans/`,
removing 3,458 lines of completed agent scaffolding. The plans still contained
31, 32, 59, and 41 unchecked task boxes and stale execution instructions even
though their declared outputs are now represented by production or diagnostic
code, focused tests, raw evidence, wiki source pages, and the open-question
ledger. No repository page, command, test, or publishing surface linked to any
of the four plan paths. Git history remains the recovery path for their
task-by-task instructions.

Retained both `docs/superpowers/specs/` design records: the path-conditioned
barycentric design is cited by a wiki analysis, and the unsupported-outcome
design records the rationale behind a live public benchmark status contract.
Retained the `.mex/` router because root `AGENTS.md` explicitly requires that
compatibility bridge. Retained `tools/repository_audit/`, which has a documented
public command, repeated project usage, and a maintained wiki tool page, and
retained `scripts/rest_request.py`, which remains part of the documented GO
annotation pipeline.

Removed the undocumented `--skip-static-manifest-validation` alias from
`verify_recent_benchmark_provenance.py`. It was introduced in the same commit as
the canonical `--skip-manifest-validation` spelling, has no repository caller or
current documentation, and therefore has no migration history or independent
consumer evidence. The canonical flag and its behaviour remain unchanged.

Retained the other reviewed candidates:

- The five AWS shard validators and two replicate-coverage validators have
  similar shapes but enforce different grid, manifest, and error-reporting
  contracts, with dedicated tests and documented commands. Consolidating them
  would couple independent studies without removing duplicated semantics.
- Exact duplicate files under `raw/assets/benchmark-results/` remain primary
  evidence and are cited by source pages and experiment contracts; they are not
  cleanup targets.
- `[tool.deptry]` remains because the documented repository-hygiene audit invokes
  it. Whether to make the tool reproducibly available through a project extra
  or an ephemeral runner is a separate dependency-policy decision.
- BranchArchitect's `biopython` and `orjson` packages remain live optional-extra
  dependencies. Whether that extra belongs in the aggregate `all` extra is an
  owner-facing packaging decision.
- `selected_quadratic_law_audit.py` remains a tested analysis surface. Its
  missing dedicated wiki record is a documentation gap, not evidence that the
  implementation is dead.

#### Development dependency pruning

Removed `radon`, `lizard`, `xenon`, and `wily` from the `dev` and aggregate
`all` extras. They had been added together as optional complexity tools, but no
repository command, audit adapter, documentation page, CI surface, or source
module invokes them; the maintained `tbs-audit` workflow uses Ruff, Vulture,
jscpd, pytest-deadfixtures, LibCST, Grimp, and coverage instead. Deptry also
reported all four as unused. Regenerating `uv.lock` removed those four packages
and seven packages used only by them, reducing the lock from 213 to 202
packages without changing runtime dependencies.

#### Repository storage pruning

Removed the tracked `manuscript/tools/vale` executable and added it to
`manuscript/.gitignore`. The 37.2 MiB file was a macOS ARM binary generated by
the maintained `manuscript/install_vale.sh` installer, so it was not portable
to other supported development platforms and duplicated the documented install
path. `manuscript/Makefile` still accepts either the installer-provided local
binary or a `vale` executable on `PATH`; `manuscript/README.md` already directs
contributors to run the installer before prose linting. This reduces checkout
size only; the historical blob remains in Git until an explicitly authorized
history migration is performed.

#### Test suite maintenance follow-up

Reconciled `tests/README.md` with the current 1,366-case collection after the
repository cleanup. Consolidated the shared selected-hierarchy geometry record
builder used by the AWS tail-equation and hierarchy-covariate studies, and
shared deterministic high-dimensional benchmark input setup across the paired
unsupported/control integration contracts without removing either outcome
test. All-missing summary medians now return `NaN` without NumPy warning noise,
while GraphTools duplicate-sample and disconnected spectral-graph warnings are
asserted narrowly at their intentional smoke-test call sites.

#### Production-boundary test pruning

Audited the 741 tests previously grouped as research calibration and scientific
validation against the installed `tree_break_selection` package boundary,
supported artifact contracts, direct assertion subjects, and exact branch
coverage. The full suite exercised 104 production lines and 49 branches beyond
the non-research suite, but that increment was concentrated in ten cases with
independent production assertions: eight neighborhood-bandwidth unit tests and
two end-to-end gate/decomposition tests. Moved those cases to
`tests/statistics/test_neighborhood_bandwidth_contract.py` and
`tests/integration/test_cluster_validation_pipeline.py`, respectively.

Removed the remaining 731 cases because they asserted research-only diagnostic
helpers, simulations, calibration panels, sweeps, report generators, or
benchmark adapters rather than a shipped product contract. Removed their
orphaned test fixtures and package scaffolding, narrowed stage 4 to the eleven
supported validation artifact-contract cases, and removed obsolete deleted-test
paths from wiki source frontmatter while preserving the underlying diagnostic
implementations and research evidence. The project gate now collects 635 cases.

#### Benchmark production-boundary cleanup

Removed 79 benchmark modules (38,557 lines) that neither invoke or reach the
`tree_break_selection` production package nor support a benchmark path covered
by the current 635-case suite. The removed cohort consisted of research-only
calibration panels, post-run analyses, mathematical trace helpers, open-question
contracts, and standalone validation programs. Preserved benchmark adapters,
artifact contracts, and diagnostic support modules exercised by current tests,
as well as all raw result captures.

Removed 65 dedicated wiki source pages for that retired research cohort and
pruned their current index, source metadata, and wikilinks. Kept eight mixed
source pages that still cite production-reaching benchmark modules. Historical
log entries remain unchanged; the wiki linter now exempts the append-only log
from dangling-link checks while continuing to enforce them on current synthesis
pages.

#### Repository-audit subsystem retirement

Retired the standalone `tbs-audit` developer subsystem after confirming its 53
tests protected only the isolated audit CLI and did not exercise the shipped
`tree_break_selection` package. Removed the seven-module implementation, six
test files, isolated manifest and lockfile, `make audit*` commands, the
`audit-test` project gate, and current README/wiki instructions as one coherent
slice. Historical log entries and the unsupported-outcome design record remain
as chronology rather than current commands.

The tracked tool project contained 16 files and 5,098 lines. Its ignored local
virtual environment and caches occupied 313 MB and were moved to Trash; Git
history preserves the tracked source. Thirty-five ignored reports and transient
coverage/lineage artifacts produced by the tool occupied another 868 MB and
were also moved to Trash. Unrelated generated scientific-audit artifacts remain
in place.

#### Remaining test-maintenance cleanup

Retired the unwired recent-benchmark provenance verifier and its 43 synthetic
tests as one coherent maintenance slice. The verifier was fixed to the June
23--24 benchmark folders, had no active build or documentation entry point, and
its real repository invocation reported 221 stale generator/source references
after application commands moved to their owned packages. Historical raw
captures and earlier log evidence remain unchanged.

Removed the pytest wrapper that invoked `scripts/wiki/lint.py` a second time
during `make check`. The canonical `make wiki-lint` gate remains responsible for
the wiki structure contract, while the three distinct mex routing and wiki
lookup behavior tests remain in the suite.

### 2026-08-09

#### Highest-confidence test cleanup

Removed two legacy-only benchmark tests after the recursive test audit found no
live requirement for their retired names. The relationship analyzer now relies
on its canonical unknown-column rejection instead of maintaining a separate
old-result-column list and error path, and the suite no longer preserves an
absence guard for the retired `kl_divergence` audit filename.

Tightened the supported TBS condensed-distance dispatch test to require an
`ok` result, and removed a redundant status assertion from the NNLS dispatch
test whose controlled runner already guarantees success. Current-schema,
method-specific audit matching, and dispatch geometry coverage remain.

### 2026-08-10

#### Optional-test and dispatch-contract cleanup

Marked scRNA, graphtools, and R-runtime coverage explicitly and changed
optional Python dependency handling to skip only genuinely missing modules;
installed but incompatible environments now fail instead of being hidden as
skips. Added the regrouped hierarchy-analysis tests to the ordered test gate.

Split the monolithic dispatch-contract module into validation, distance-input,
parameter-forwarding, compatibility-outcome, method-registry, and profile
contracts. Parameterized the repeated gate-profile resolver, method-registry,
and KL-dispatch matrices while preserving the 589 collected behavioral cases.

#### Retired superseded fixed-coordinate profiles

Removed the superseded `fixed_coordinate_selective_traversal_v1` and
`fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_v1` named presets from the production
profile registry. Their `open_internal` and unrefined global selected-family
guard implementations remain available through explicit configuration and are
still covered directly; raw captures and wiki source summaries preserve the
experimental results that motivated their refined successors.

Also removed the behavior-identical
`fixed_coordinate_spectral_transport_passthrough_diagnostic_v1` profile alias
and `tbs_spectral_transport_passthrough_diagnostic` benchmark method alias. The
canonical opt-in `fixed_coordinate_spectral_transport_passthrough_v1` profile
and `tbs_spectral_transport_passthrough` method retain the same strict spectral
transport guard behavior.

#### Consolidated the conditional-topology runtime profile

Removed `fixed_coordinate_conditional_topology_diagnostic_v1` from the
production profile registry after confirming that every executable setting was
identical to `fixed_coordinate_guarded_v1`. The distinct maturity label and
description belonged to the benchmark study, not to runtime behavior.

The benchmark-facing `tbs_conditional_topology_diagnostic` method id remains
available and now resolves to `fixed_coordinate_guarded_v1`. Conditional-
topology diagnostic scripts and new output metadata use that canonical profile;
historical raw results retain the retired profile id as provenance.

#### Retired root and selective-pass-through validation profiles

Removed `fixed_coordinate_selective_root_v1` and
`fixed_coordinate_selective_passthrough_v1` from the production profile
registry after their diagnostic roles were superseded. The selected-family
panel default now compares the projected-Wald baseline, guarded fixed-coordinate
profile, and refined global selected-family profile.

Migrated the root tree-geometry replay and its categorical false-root regression
to explicit fixed-coordinate, root-stability, and selected-root permutation
parameters before removing the root profile ID. The underlying default-off
guard scopes and their direct behavioral coverage remain; raw captures and
historical wiki measurements retain the retired identifiers as provenance.

#### Retired redundant benchmark and fixed-global profile IDs

Removed the behavior-identical `tbs_conditional_topology_diagnostic` benchmark
method alias. It resolved to `fixed_coordinate_guarded_v1` and never applied
the conditional-topology law during traversal; the canonical profile and the
separate topology-law diagnostic remain. Alias-only registry, dispatch, and
duplicate precomputed-distance tests were removed with it.

Migrated the fixed-global runner regression to explicit
`fixed_global_chi_square`, selected-topology penalty, and root-stability
parameters, then removed `fixed_global_guarded_v1` from the runtime registry and
profile-validation defaults. The statistic and its behavioral regression
remain available without the obsolete public profile ID. Raw captures preserve
`fixed_global_guarded_v1` and the predecessor conditional-topology IDs; wiki
history preserves the later `tbs_conditional_topology_diagnostic` alias. Stale
wiki links to already-removed validation test files were deleted.

#### Retired the spectral-transport traversal experiment

Removed the opt-in `fixed_coordinate_spectral_transport_passthrough_v1`
profile and `tbs_spectral_transport_passthrough` benchmark method after the
calibration evidence showed signal-retention regressions and the referenced
result directories proved empty or untracked. The spectral-transport gate
module, traversal/config plumbing, two dedicated calibration panels,
spectral-only tests, and four obsolete wiki source pages were removed with the
public IDs.

Also removed spectral-transport-only output fields from the selected-family
panel and the optional spectral branch from the topology-frontier replay and
its callers. Generic selected-family pass-through support, the independent
PCA/Marchenko-Pastur spectral context, adjacent selected-neighborhood
spectral-flow diagnostics, immutable raw captures, and historical log entries
remain intact.

#### Retired selected-neighborhood spectral-flow diagnostics

Removed the two benchmark-only selected-neighborhood spectral-flow panels
after recursive reachability found no registered runner or consumer beyond the
panels themselves and an optional diagnostic CSV join. Their validation tests
had already been retired as research-only, all seven referenced result
directories were empty, and a fresh one-case run contradicted the retained
internal-support narrative.

Removed the unused spectral-flow join and output fields from the
selected-neighborhood measurability evaluator, plus the orphaned exported
`CoherentSupportDecision` and its self-contained test. The live PCA/MP spectral
context, internal-barycenter and branch-length-state estimator options,
registered internal-filter methods, and the remaining neighborhood bandwidth
distance, role, kernel, and tau primitives are unchanged. Deleted the two
obsolete source pages and removed their unsupported claims from retained wiki
synthesis; raw captures and earlier chronology remain untouched.

#### Corrected the spectral-flow retirement boundary after review

Versioned the reduced measurability CSV contract as
`selected_neighborhood_measurability_law/v2`, removed retained prose that still
described the deleted mode-transport implementation, and removed the retired
spectral bottleneck from the conceptual status list. The measurability source
page now cites only its live implementation, omits numerical and test-coverage
claims unsupported by local evidence, and is draft until a non-empty result
capture and focused contract tests are restored.

#### Retired the selected-neighborhood topology-frontier slice

Removed the benchmark-only selected-neighborhood topology frontier, generated
neighborhood replay, conditioned topology join, same-geometry external-support
attempt, and selected spectral-generator target panel. Recursive import and
artifact tracing found no production consumer, registered runner, current test,
or non-empty retained result capture for the five-module branch.

Removed the topology-derived bandwidth and hybrid-support coordinates from the
retained mixed-root law, calibration-feasibility, selected-null pilot, shared
root-tail key, and spectral-tail contracts. The mixed-root event remains
conditioned on margin, tie-cell, and tie-rank evidence; the spectral-tail key
now uses the reduced component, tie, action, edge, and population-law
coordinates. Surviving spectral-tail and deformed-MP runners now require their
feasibility input explicitly instead of pointing to deleted historical join
artifacts. Unsupported source pages were removed and retained synthesis was
reduced to locally supported code contracts.

#### Corrected the topology-frontier retirement boundary after review

Migrated the retained target-conditioned importance frontier from its
`pre_topology` schema and replay-oriented outcomes to a versioned final
conditioning contract whose matched candidates proceed directly to the
selected-root tail evaluation. Migrated the spectral-lift sweep to version 2,
renamed `next_replay_step` to `next_diagnostic_step`, and removed statuses that
directed candidates toward the retired generated-neighborhood topology stage.

Removed the stale bandwidth coordinate from the calibration package contract
and the dead selected-root result-root default. The deformed-MP runner now also
requires its \(H_u\)-observability input explicitly because the former producer
and captured output are absent; its orphaned source page was removed. Rewrote
the affected root source pages and index/analysis summaries around tracked code
evidence, removed empty result-directory citations and unsupported smoke-run
numbers, and marked empirical pages draft until durable captures and focused
tests exist.

The final checkpoint review also corrected the calibration category map so the
surviving tie-rank package is described by feasibility, selected-null
simulation, proposal, and spectral-tail responsibilities rather than the
retired replay stage.

#### Removed historical root-diagnostic input defaults

Required explicit predecessor CSV paths across the retained selected-root and
tie-rank diagnostic chain instead of silently binding live entry points to the
dated 2026-06-15 result tree. The target-conditioned frontier now treats its
optional tail rows as absent unless a caller supplies them, and a supplied
missing path fails rather than silently selecting all observed targets.
The spectral-tail panel applies the same rule to its optional deformed-MP rows
and support rows.

Removed two uncalled root CLI helper modules and the two tests that only kept
those helpers reachable. Numerical parameter defaults, diagnostic algorithms,
production code, raw captures, and append-only history remain unchanged.

#### Retired the selected-root spectral-tail research boundary

Removed the deformed-MP edge panel, selected-root spectral-tail evaluator, and
target-conditioned importance selector after audit found no maintained runner,
current test, retained capture, or complete artifact loop. Removed their direct
source pages and the shared root-tail helpers that became orphaned.

Preserved the broader null-proposal and spectral-lift reach diagnostics. The
spectral-lift contract is now version 3 and reports standalone root-metric
reach evidence without claiming that candidates feed a retained tail evaluator
or define production p-values. Production tree code, raw captures, and earlier
chronology remain unchanged.

#### Corrected the remaining spectral-tail retirement documentation

Removed the calibration package's stale reference to optional
target-conditioned tail rows and corrected the wiki index so the retained
kernel-spectral synthesis is described as an unresolved historical research
direction, not a current calibrated-tail contract.

#### Retired the terminal root spectral-lift sweep

Removed the standalone root tie-rank spectral-lift parameter sweep after the
recursive audit found no downstream consumer, registered runner, focused test,
packaged surface, or non-empty retained result capture. Removed its direct
source page and the selected-root log-action and spectral-excess helpers that
became orphaned.

The calibration-feasibility, selected-null simulation, and null-proposal
frontier diagnostics remain for a separate dependency review. Production code,
raw evidence, and earlier chronology remain unchanged.

#### Consolidated test duplication and execution groups

Reduced the maintained suite from 566 to 563 cases by removing one exact
semantic duplicate and one ineffective test whose branch-length variables never
reached the production call. Consolidated repeated case matrices and fixtures
without merging distinct behavioral outcomes. The exact-clone audit fell from
17 clones and 325 duplicated lines to two intentionally retained seam-local
clones and 27 duplicated lines.

Updated the seven-stage suite map to match collection and marked eight
catalog-wide or end-to-end cases as slow so the fast lean gate, complete
non-optional gate, and expensive regression slice can be selected explicitly.
Production code and supported behavioral coverage remain unchanged.

#### Isolated the IQ-TREE subprocess test seam

Corrected the IQ-TREE construction test so its command stub replaces only the
phylogenetic module's subprocess binding instead of mutating the process-wide
`subprocess.run` function. The previous mock was order-dependent: it passed
after another test imported scikit-bio but failed alone when a lazy dependency
used subprocess for a platform probe. The standalone test, its complete file,
and the 194-case core/decomposition stage now pass without changing production
behavior.

#### Removed benchmark orphans exposed by research-test pruning

Removed seven uncalled diagnostic symbols left behind when research-only tests
and the math-trace inference entrypoint were retired: an unused cached-distance
count property, the scalar hold-out interpolation path and its private helper,
an orphaned table classifier, and the child-null-prior result, validator, and
calculator used only by that scalar path. The maintained vectorized hold-out
interpolation path, row-level failure classifier, cached-distance behavior, and
selected-neighborhood evaluator remain unchanged.

#### Audited the maintained test boundary

Recursively audited 128 tracked test files containing 531 test functions and
562 collected cases. No test met the two-signal deletion rule: the one exact
test-body pair protects separate module constants, while delegated assertions,
protocol hooks, and optional-runtime skips remain live. Corrected the suite map
from 563 to 562 cases and the statistics stage from 196 to 195 after the recent
statistical-test pruning.

### 2026-08-11

#### Removed confirmed unfinished-work anti-patterns

Removed the unused `--plot-all` option and made selected-edge AWS resume control
explicitly disableable while preserving resume as the default. Added the
dependency and dead-code audits to the locked development tools and `make
check`, removed the obsolete `python-louvain` dependency after the runner's
NetworkX implementation was traced, and documented justified dynamic/runtime
dependency exceptions. Repaired repository-relative links in the categorical
overlap diagnosis, removed an empty unreferenced guide, and added a focused CLI
contract test.

#### Audited the production clustering package

Recursively enumerated 125 Python modules under `tree_break_selection/`,
including 90 concrete modules, 35 package initializers, 469 classes, functions,
and methods, and 206 internal import edges. Repository entry points reach every
concrete module; test paths reach 88, while application consumers reach the two
remaining plotting modules. The package contains no orphan concrete module,
exact duplicate function body, or incomplete function body.

Removed `GateEvaluator.passthrough_support_status`, whose only consumer was a
redundant test assertion and whose two diagnostic fields are already supplied
by the production-used `passthrough_audit_status`. Retained the remaining
lower-confidence detector findings because they are live application,
benchmark, or test contracts; exported result properties; or public dataclass
fields whose external-consumer boundary is unresolved.

#### Audited retained production candidates against downstream consumers

Reproduced the 56 retained Vulture candidates and inspected the 36 direct-child
Git repositories under `/Users/berksakalli/Projects`, the public source
repository and its two public forks, PyPI, indexed public code, current package
contracts, tests, documentation, and history. Removed the unexported
`extract_row_column_maps` helper, its three self-referential tests, and its
`core_utils` catalog row after no runtime, downstream, copied-implementation, or
indexed public consumer was found. The remaining 55 findings are retained
contracts or require an owner decision because their public-consumer boundary
cannot be proven closed. A fixed-point pass then exposed
`BranchLengthOptimizationResult.to_dict`, whose current benchmark runner caller
confirms it as a live false positive outside the production-only Vulture scan;
the final detector count therefore remains 56.

#### Corrected empirical-null calibration ownership and reference laws

Separated the immutable calibration sample from fitted scale state, replaced
record-level stopping support with nearest-stopping-event dependency groups,
validated every support-threshold boundary, enforced blocked-record role
consistency, and replaced the tuple threshold signature with an immutable
version-2 policy snapshot. Removed the redundant stopped-or-null count and its
threshold after migrating internal and benchmark consumers.

Derived and implemented a separately named exact-F path only for independent,
pairwise-disjoint, unit-weighted common-scale calibration data. The production
same-selected-hierarchy path now preserves raw statistics and scale diagnostics
but fails closed for positive-dimensional records with
`undefined_unvalidated_reference_law`; it no longer reports the plug-in
chi-square tail as a calibrated p-value.

The final project check passed Ruff, Deptry, Vulture, the 190-page wiki lint,
and all 597 tests across the seven ordered test stages.
