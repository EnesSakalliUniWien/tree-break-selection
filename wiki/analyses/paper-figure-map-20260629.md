# Paper Figure Map 2026-06-29

## Summary

The current manuscript has one visual figure wired into LaTeX: the TBS pipeline
overview in `manuscript/sections/method/overview.tex`, assembled from TikZ
modules under `manuscript/figures/`. The `experiments` section is still a
prospective evaluation plan, so the benchmark and report figures are generated
evidence pools rather than locked manuscript figures.

Across `manuscript/figures`, `reports/`, and
`raw/assets/benchmark-results`, there are `685` generated or hand-authored
visual artifacts with extensions `.tex`, `.png`, `.pdf`, or `.html`. The
practical map is therefore bundle-level: canonical manuscript figure,
explanatory toy figures, active scRNA review figures, GO/subspace figure
decks, MNIST exploratory figures, and older diagnostic/legacy figure pools.

## Details

### Status legend

- `Manuscript-wired`: included by the current LaTeX manuscript.
- `Candidate`: plausible paper or supplement material, but not currently
  included in `manuscript/main.tex`.
- `Evidence pool`: generated review or diagnostic figures supporting project
  interpretation.
- `Legacy/diagnostic`: historical or negative-control figures; keep as raw
  evidence but do not promote without a new locked result contract.

### Current manuscript figure

| `manuscript/figures/essential_tikz_figures.tex` | Candidate/unused | Included in the `12` `.tex` count | Holds older standalone TikZ sketches for pipeline, edge/sibling principles, sibling calibration, and traversal. Not currently included by `main.tex`. |

## Evidence

- `manuscript/sections/method/overview.tex` includes the only current
  manuscript figure environment and loads `figures/pipeline_overview_single_page`.
- `manuscript/sections/experiments/section.tex` states that the results
  section is still prospective and requires locked scripts, manifests, seeds,
  and output files before reported figures enter the paper.
- A local inventory over `manuscript/figures`, `reports`, and
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results` found `685` visual artifacts: `12` manuscript
  `.tex` figure files, `12` toy-tree PNGs, and `661` result/report artifacts
  under `raw/assets/benchmark-results`.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/pancreas_scrna_cluster_benchmark_20260623/plot_manifest.csv`
  maps all `120` adult pancreas PNG/PDF files to role, stage, generator,
  canonical status, alias target, and intended question.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/goncalves_fetal_pancreas_progenitor_benchmark_20260624/plot_manifest.csv`
  maps `74` Goncalves PNG/PDF files; the unmanifested visual pair is
  `goncalves_progenitor_coherence_score.{png,pdf}`.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/mnist_tbs_analysis_20260624/manifest.json`,
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/mnist_tbs_analysis_20260624_plotly/manifest.json`,
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/scrna_selected_adaptive_diffusion_nnls_manifest.json`,
  and
  `raw/assets/benchmark-results/scrna_selected_adaptive_diffusion_nnls_matched_manifest.json`
  record figure/report artifacts and provenance for those bundles.

## Open Questions

- Which generated evidence-pool figures should become locked manuscript or
  supplement figures once the experiments section is replaced?
- Should the toy-tree explanatory figures be promoted into the method section,
  or should the current TikZ pipeline overview remain the only method visual?
- Should legacy/diagnostic figure bundles be moved out of top-level benchmark
  result directories, or should readers continue filtering them through
  manifests and this map?
