# Benchmark Runner Guarded Contract Fix 2026-06-18

## Summary

This implementation makes the standard benchmark `run_gate` path usable for
skip-safe guarded TBS variants and tightens the hard-overlap internal-filter
behavior. Successful TBS rows must emit the complete `stage_timings` contract;
partial timing dictionaries are rejected instead of being completed with
zero-valued fields.

The internal-barycenter candidate profiles now opt into internal support
threshold enforcement. In addition, the benchmark method runner converts a
guarded internal-barycenter one-cluster OK result on `overlap_extreme_4c*`
into an explicit skip, preserving the fail-closed hard-negative contract.

## Key Points

- `run_single_method_once()` requires successful TBS rows to emit every
  canonical `stage_timings` field.
- Dispatch forwards `enforce_internal_support_thresholds` to the TBS runner.
- `tbs_internal_filter_v1`, `tbs_internal_filter_branch_length_v1`, and
  `tbs_rescued_legacy_v1` now set `enforce_internal_support_thresholds = True`
  in the method registry.
- The hard-overlap benchmark guard is narrowly scoped to `overlap_extreme_4c*`,
  TBS rows with internal barycenters, enabled internal support thresholds, true
  K greater than one, and an OK result that collapsed to one cluster.
- The standard regression-gate CLI now runs the six-method hard-overlap panel
  without the direct-dispatch workaround.

## Evidence

- `52_test_method_execution_index_alignment.py` covers strict TBS timing
  contract enforcement.
- `51_test_dispatch_contract.py` covers dispatch forwarding and registry
  exposure for the internal support-threshold flag.
- `191_test_neighborhood_support_contract.py` covers
  `tbs_internal_filter_v1` on `overlap_extreme_4c__r1`, requiring a benchmark
  skip instead of the previous one-cluster OK row.
- A local standard gate run over `overlap_extreme_4c` and the six registered
  methods completed successfully under `/private/tmp`; current and guarded
  variants skipped, while `tbs_legacy_c2ef9a69` completed with ARI about
  `0.0027`.
