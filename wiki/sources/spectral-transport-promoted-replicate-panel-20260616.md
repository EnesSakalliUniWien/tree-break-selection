# Spectral Transport Promoted Replicate Panel 2026-06-16

## Summary

The 50-replicate selected-family panel tests whether the promoted spectral
transport pass-through profile should become the default traversal rule. It
does not support default promotion. The strict MP-support guard sharply reduces
selected-null false splits, but it also blocks four signal replicates and fails
the zero-regression promotion gate.

## Key Points

- The run covers `overlap_part_4c_small`, `overlap_mod_4c_small`, and
  `overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat` under selected-null and signal roles, with
  `50` replicates for both `fixed_coordinate_global_passthrough_refined_v1`
  and `fixed_coordinate_spectral_transport_passthrough_v1`.
- Selected-null behavior improves strongly: baseline false-split count is
  `117/150`, candidate false-split count is `3/150`, and `114` false splits
  are reduced with no introduced selected-null false splits.
- Signal behavior is not clean enough for default traversal. There are `4`
  signal regressions out of `150` paired signal rows, with minimum signal
  delta ARI `-0.822005` and mean signal delta ARI `-0.006734`.
- The four signal regressions are root-level spectral pass-through blocks:
  three in `overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat` and one in `overlap_mod_4c_small`.
  Each candidate row collapses to one cluster after the strict MP-support
  guard blocks pass-through.
- The replicate-aware promotion gate returns
  `diagnostic_only_not_promoted`, blocked by
  `selected_family_signal_retention`.
- `fixed_coordinate_spectral_transport_passthrough_v1` therefore remains an
  opt-in candidate, not the default traversal rule.

## Evidence

- `selected_family_traversal_panel.py` wrote `600` selected-family traversal
  rows plus node, region, sample, guard, and production-admissibility outputs.
- `spectral_transport_promotion_gate.py` evaluated the 50-replicate selected
  family rows together with the promoted standard-dispatch panel and recorded
  `2` required promotion components passing and `1` failing.
- `orchestrator.py` marks
  `fixed_coordinate_spectral_transport_passthrough_v1` as
  `opt_in_candidate_not_default` after this run.
