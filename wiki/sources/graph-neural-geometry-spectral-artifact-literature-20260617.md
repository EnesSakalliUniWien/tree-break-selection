# Graph Neural Geometry Spectral Artifact Literature 2026-06-17

## Summary

This literature capture connects Tree-Break Selection's internal-barycenter and
selected-neighborhood spectral problem to graph signal processing, graph neural
network smoothing theory, and graph geometry. The central message is
consistent across the papers: graph smoothing and low-pass filtering can
increase coherent-looking spectral support, but this is not sufficient for a
valid decision because smoothing can also create selected-null artifacts,
oversmooth discriminative structure, or distort flow through bottlenecks.

For Tree-Break Selection, internal distributions should therefore be treated as a graph
low-pass/tree-filter diagnostic. They need angle/radius persistence and
selected-topology conditioning before they can support a decision.

## Key Points

- Graph signal processing defines graph Fourier modes, graph filters, and
  localized multiscale transforms. This is the right mathematical frame for
  Tree-Break Selection's internal-barycenter operator: it is a graph/tree low-pass filter, not
  an independent-sample generator.
- Spectral graph wavelets, diffusion wavelets, and graph scattering support
  multiscale persistence diagnostics. A real coarse mode should persist across
  graph scales; a local fragment should be high-frequency or unstable.
- GCN theory repeatedly identifies graph convolution as Laplacian smoothing or
  low-pass filtering. This explains why internal barycenters can help:
  smoothing denoises and raises coarse signal power.
- The oversmoothing literature gives the warning. Repeated smoothing can drive
  embeddings toward indistinguishable low-energy states, so smoothness alone
  is not discriminative evidence.
- The Tree-Break Selection diagnostic result mirrors that warning: internal barycenters create
  many new MP-supported edges on both selected-null and signal rows.
- Oversquashing/curvature papers identify graph bottlenecks as places where
  information flow is distorted. For Tree-Break Selection, root validity, selected tie-rank,
  edge action, child balance, and topology replay are the corresponding
  conditioning coordinates.
- Vector diffusion maps and the connection Laplacian are the closest analogy
  for the angle-specific transport panel. They use local vector-frame
  transport and connection consistency; Tree-Break Selection's version compares principal
  angles/projectors and log-eigenvalue radii across selected-tree spectral
  objects.
