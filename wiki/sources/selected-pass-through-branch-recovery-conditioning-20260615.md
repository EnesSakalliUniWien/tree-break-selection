# Selected Pass-Through Branch Recovery Conditioning 2026-06-15

## Summary

`selected_pass_through_branch_recovery_conditioning.py` is a diagnostic-only
panel for retained selected pass-through walks. It separates the oracle target
classes that were conflated in the previous selected-event analysis:

- full branch recovery;
- partial branch recovery;
- barycentric mixture;
- false fragment;
- selected-null control;
- unresolved signal.

The panel explicitly separates oracle truth-geometry metrics from observable
topology metrics. This prevents benchmark truth labels from becoming a hidden
production rule.

The panel now also has an optional non-oracle feature-geometry layer. Given
`multiscale_gene_assignments.csv`, it reconstructs selected-node path
membership, identifies the two child paths under the downstream accepted split,
regenerates the benchmark feature matrix from `data_seed`, and computes
homogeneity/subspace-consensus scores without using truth labels as predictors.

The panel also includes a generated selected-pass-through support fixture. It
uses existing binary benchmark generators plus synthetic selected path
membership to create full branch recovery, partial branch recovery,
barycentric mixture, fragment, and selected-null controls that exercise the
same path-based feature-geometry code.

## Key Points

- The focused fixture contains `9` analytical rows: `3` full branch
  recoveries, `1` partial branch recovery, `1` barycentric mixture, `2` false
  fragments, and `2` selected-null controls.
- In the focused fixture, oracle branch indicators separate all branch
  recoveries:
  `truth_downstream_child_majority_distinct_numeric` and
  `branch_recovery_oracle_score` both have
  `zero_negative_separates_all_branch_recovery`.
- The original balance-only observable topology metrics do not cleanly
  separate the same branch positives. `structural_balance_product` and
  `completed_balance_product` both have AUC `0.9`, but leak a selected-null
  control.
- The new non-oracle feature-geometry metrics do separate the focused fixture:
  `feature_branch_geometry_score`, `feature_homogeneity_gain_min`,
  `feature_subspace_consensus_jaccard_topk`, and
  `feature_heterogeneity_subspace_consensus_jaccard_topk` all report
  `zero_negative_separates_all_branch_recovery`.
- With feature geometry enabled, the focused diagnostic status becomes
  `branch_recovery_conditioning_fixture_observed_diagnostic_only`; production
  still remains fail-closed.
- The real expanded overlap selected-pass-through run contains `50` rows:
  `0` full branch recoveries, `0` partial branch recoveries, `1` barycentric
  mixture, `14` false fragments, `31` selected-null controls, and `4`
  unresolved signal rows.
- Feature geometry is observed for all `50` real rows. It does not change the
  real-run blocker, because there are still no branch-recovery positives to
  estimate a branch-vs-control law from.
- The generated support fixture contains `9` rows: `3` full branch recoveries,
  `1` partial branch recovery, `1` barycentric mixture, `1` false fragment, and
  `3` selected-null controls. The three full branch recoveries have downstream
  ARI `1.0` and mean child purity `1.0`.
- In the generated support fixture, `feature_homogeneity_gain_min` and
  `feature_branch_geometry_score` both report
  `zero_negative_separates_all_branch_recovery`. Balance product still leaks,
  confirming that the new evidence is feature-subspace geometry, not descendant
  mass balance.
- A targeted real traversal-selected branch-positive search over
  `binary_perfect_4c`, `binary_low_noise_4c`, `binary_moderate_4c`, and
  `overlap_part_4c_small` mined `12` selected pass-through event rows:
  `7` signal rows and `5` selected-null controls. The `7` signal rows are all
  truth-classified as `false_fragment`; there are `0` full branch recoveries,
  `0` partial branch recoveries, and `0` barycentric mixtures in this real
  search.
- In that real search, completed balance product separates selected-event
  signal rows from selected-null controls in the low direction
  (`0.028841` signal maximum versus `0.126518` selected-null finite minimum),
  but this is not a recovery law because the selected-event signal rows are
  false fragments.
- Feature geometry is observed for all `12` targeted real-search rows, but
  the summary still reports `full_branch_recovery_support_missing`.
- The full binary-suite real traversal-selected search covers all `42` binary
  benchmark cases with `3` replicates, null and signal roles, and the two
  compared traversal profiles. It mines `92` selected pass-through event rows:
  `61` signal-side candidates and `31` selected-null controls.
- The full-suite signal-side selected-event rows still contain no branch
  recovery: `56` are `false_fragment`, `5` are `unresolved_signal`, and `0`
  are full or partial branch recoveries.
- Feature geometry is observed for all `92` full-suite rows, but branch
  recovery support is absent, so all observable and oracle branch-separation
  metrics have `finite_branch_count = 0`.
- Completed balance product overlaps selected-null controls in the full suite:
  signal-side values range from `0.000840` to `0.133971`, while selected-null
  finite values range from `0.035000` to `0.237692`, with `7` selected-null
  controls below the low-direction signal threshold.
- Enabling the existing method-proof planted hierarchy case
  `traversal_deep_signal_under_same_parent` in the selected-family traversal
  runner produces `2` selected pass-through signal rows, but both remain
  `signal_truth_unresolved` with downstream ARI near `0.19`; this is still not
  branch-recovery support.
- A stronger registered method-proof case,
  `traversal_deep_branch_recovery_stress`, uses sparse, very strong
  descendant blocks with very weak root contrast. It creates many selected
  pass-through events, but they are still false fragments: the selected-event
  miner finds `29` rows, `28` signal-side candidates, `1` selected-null
  control, `0` full branch recoveries, and `0` partial branch recoveries.
- The candidate own-split audit on the same stronger stress run finds clean
  branch recovery elsewhere in the selected tree: `13` own-split branch
  recoveries and `3` partial branch recoveries among selected candidates. All
  `13` full branch recoveries are accepted split rows, not pass-through rows;
  pass-through candidates have maximum own-split ARI `0.140288`.
- The reusable selected-candidate truth-law panel repeats that audit while
  retaining selected-null controls. It reports `116` selected candidate rows:
  `114` signal rows, `2` selected-null controls, `13` full branch recoveries,
  `3` partial branch recoveries, `84` false fragments, and `14` unresolved
  signal rows. The diagnostic status is
  `branch_recovery_observed_only_on_accepted_splits`.
- Subsequent broader candidate-level transfer runs refine that conclusion. The
  retained selected-event miner remains negative, but the selected-candidate
  truth-law panel finds a few real pass-through branch-positive candidates:
  `2` in expanded overlap and `1` in the full binary-suite audit. These rows
  have weak immediate-split feature geometry and do not yield a zero-leakage
  feature cutoff, so they require a traversal-state-conditioned law rather than
  pass-through promotion by homogeneity alone.
- The real-run diagnostic status is
  `full_branch_recovery_support_missing`.
- Production action remains `fail_closed_until_branch_law_validated`.

## Mathematical Interpretation

For a retained pass-through node \(u\), let \(v(u)\) be the nearest accepted
descendant split under \(u\). Let

\[
A_u =
\operatorname{ARI}
\left(
\text{children}(v(u)),
\text{truth labels inside }v(u)
\right),
\]

\[
\pi_u = \text{mean child truth purity at }v(u),
\quad
D_u =
\mathbf 1\{
\text{child majority truth labels differ at }v(u)
\}.
\]

The oracle branch score is:

\[
R_u = D_u A_u \pi_u.
\]

The barycentric mixture score is:

\[
B_u = (1-D_u) A_u \pi_u.
\]

The feature-geometry layer defines a non-oracle branch proxy at the downstream
split \(v(u)\). Let \(X_v\) be the parent feature matrix and \(X_L,X_R\) the
two downstream child matrices. Let \(J(\cdot)\) denote mean pairwise binary
Jaccard similarity, and let \(H_v\) be the top-feature set for variance
reduction from \(X_v\) into the children. Let \(\Delta_v=\bar X_L-\bar X_R\)
and let \(E_L,E_R\) be the two child-parent edge directions. The observed
homogeneity gain and subspace consensus are:

\[
G_v =
\min\{J(X_L)-J(X_v), J(X_R)-J(X_v)\},
\]

\[
C_v =
\min\{
J(\operatorname{top}(\Delta_v), H_v),
J(\operatorname{top}(\Delta_v), \operatorname{top}(E_L)\cup\operatorname{top}(E_R)),
J(H_v, \operatorname{top}(E_L)\cup\operatorname{top}(E_R))
\}.
\]

The diagnostic branch-geometry score is:

\[
Q_v =
\max(G_v,0)\, C_v\,
\frac{\|\Delta_v\|}{1+\|\Delta_v\|}.
\]

The focused fixture now shows that \(Q_v\) and its components can replace the
oracle branch indicator in an analytical setting. The real overlap run shows
the remaining gap is support, not measurement: the feature geometry is present,
but the mined rows contain no full or partial branch-recovery positives.

The generated support fixture narrows this further. It proves that the
path-based feature-geometry implementation can recover clean branch-positive
support when the selected pass-through path contains a coherent downstream
feature subspace. It does not prove production validity, because the selected
path is synthetic and not sampled from the same selected traversal null law.
The remaining mathematical object is therefore a selected-neighborhood law for
real traversal-selected branch-positive support and matched selected-null
controls.

The real overlap run then shows that the currently mined selected-pass-through
rows do not contain clean branch positives. The one non-fragment signal row is a
barycentric mixture: it changes mixture proportions downstream but does not
produce distinct child-majority truth branches.

The targeted real traversal-selected branch-positive search sharpens this
failure mode. Even in clean binary four-cluster cases plus `overlap_part_4c`,
the mined selected pass-through event does not produce branch-recovery support.
Its low completed-balance signal rows are all false fragments. Therefore the
old bandwidth-style lesson cannot be "retain low-balance selected-event
walks"; the law must additionally require feature-subspace homogeneity gain
and same-subspace child contrast, and it still needs real traversal-selected
branch positives before any threshold can be promoted.

The full binary-suite search makes the negative evidence stronger. Selected
pass-through events are not rare, but in the current diagnostic profiles they
are not the desired branch-recovery events. They mostly expose false fragments
and selected-null controls, with a small unresolved-signal tail. This means the
next method fixture cannot be obtained by simply broadening the existing binary
benchmark sweep. It must either construct a targeted real traversal-selected
stress case whose truth geometry contains retained branch recovery, or change
the selected event definition before fitting any branch-retention law.

The method-proof stress fixture resolves which side of that fork is more
plausible. Strengthening descendant signal creates real branch-positive
selected candidates, but those positives are already accepted splits. The
selected pass-through event remains concentrated on homogeneous fragments.
Therefore the immediate law should not be a pass-through promotion rule. The
next useful object is a candidate-level truth law that distinguishes accepted
branch splits from homogeneous retained pass-through fragments, and uses that
to make the pass-through guard stricter, not looser.

The reusable selected-candidate truth-law panel formalizes the same conclusion
and keeps the matched selected-null candidate controls in the output. Its
stress-run status is `branch_recovery_observed_only_on_accepted_splits`: the
branch-positive rows are real, but they are not retained pass-through rows.
