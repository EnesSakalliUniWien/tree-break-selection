# Sibling Null Prior Interpolation Audit 2026-06-04

## Summary

This diagnostic reconstructs the old tree-neighborhood sibling-null prior
score from current explicit child-parent edge columns. It compares that score
against the active strict internal calibration support contract. The diagnostic
does not install interpolated priors as production calibration and records its
role as `diagnostic_interpolated_sibling_null_prior_not_calibration`.

The first run covers four representative cases:
`binary_perfect_4c`, `cat_highcard_20cat_4c`,
`overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat`, and `phylo_large_32taxa`. The second run covers
the 24 TBS calibration-support skips from
`benchmarks/results/run_20260604_115308Z_full/full_benchmark_comparison.csv`;
it excludes the separate high-dimensional continuous covariance-boundary skip.

## Key Points

- All four cases had `no_strict_internal_support`: every current positive
  calibration-weight record was selected non-null under edge evidence, not
  strict null-like or stopped-edge supported.
- The diagnostic interpolation still assigns positive weights to selected
  non-null records: `3/6` in `binary_perfect_4c`, `196/199` in
  `cat_highcard_20cat_4c`, `499/499` in `overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat`, and
  `288/319` in `phylo_large_32taxa`.
- Candidate interpolated scalar scales are descriptive only:
  `19.26` for `binary_perfect_4c`, `1.00` for `cat_highcard_20cat_4c`,
  `18.68` for `overlap_heavy_4c_small_feat`, and `37.14` for
  `phylo_large_32taxa`.
- The old score therefore diagnoses why the previous method could avoid a hard
  support failure, but also why it was mathematically inadmissible as
  empirical-null support: it borrows selected non-null records.
- The diagnostic uses direct tested-edge BH p-values for tested child edges and
  requires an explicit stopped ancestor for untested or ancestor-blocked child
  edges. Missing stopped-ancestor support stays unsupported; no neutral prior
  is inserted.
- Dimensionless stable edges are counted separately instead of receiving an
  invented structural dimension. For `binary_perfect_4c`, eight stable
  dimensionless edges were present.
- In the 24-case full-skip audit, every row again has
  `no_strict_internal_support`. The diagnostic interpolation assigns positive
  selected-nonnull weight in 23 of 24 rows. The only row without any positive
  diagnostic weight is `gauss_extreme_noise_highd`.
- Among the 23 rows with positive diagnostic interpolation, the candidate
  scalar scale ranges from `1.00` to `174.00`, with median `13.05`. The largest
  descriptive scale appears in `phylo_large_64taxa`; other high rows include
  `binary_noise_feat_30i_500n`, `gauss_null_large`, and
  `phylo_large_32taxa`.

## Evidence

- `benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/sibling/nulls/sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit.py`
  implements the explicit edge-column diagnostic, writes `case_summary.csv`,
  `record_interpolation_audit.csv`, and a manifest, and marks production method
  changes as false.
- `tests/validation/calibration/sibling/nulls/60_test_sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit.py` verifies
  direct tested-edge priors, stopped-ancestor interpolation, unsupported
  missing-ancestor states, and output writing.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit_20260604/case_summary.csv`
  records the four representative case summaries.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit_20260604/record_interpolation_audit.csv`
  records the per-sibling-pair priors, strict support flags, and selected
  non-null flags.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit_full_skips_20260604/case_summary.csv`
  records the 24-case calibration-support skip audit.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/sibling_null_prior_interpolation_audit_full_skips_20260604/record_interpolation_audit.csv`
  records `5,800` sibling-pair audit rows from the 24 skipped cases.
