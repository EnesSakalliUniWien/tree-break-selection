# Root Selected Region Margins 20260603

## Summary

`benchmarks/diagnostics/calibration/root/selected/root_selected_region_margins.py` replays
the average-linkage hierarchy used by Tree-Break Selection and records the merge-selection
inequality margins that construct the two root child clusters. It joins those
margins to observed root edge, sibling, and spectral quantities. The diagnostic
is descriptive selected-region geometry, not an external calibration model.
Schema `v5` also records smooth first-order signed-distance geometry when the
tree metric is Euclidean and explicitly marks discrete or nonsmooth tie-cell
geometry otherwise. For continuous Euclidean cases, it additionally computes
the first-order null-whitened distance under the root empirical-Gaussian
feature covariance. Schema `v5` also records the child-parent projected-Wald
edge-opening boundary in fixed-subspace \(z\)-space:
\(\sqrt Q-\sqrt{q_{1-\alpha,k}}\), plus edge statistic margins and
edge-path p-value actions. It also records the local algebraic relationship
between root child-parent edge z-vectors and the root sibling z-vector. These
are descriptive geometry fields, not a production calibration rule. Schema
`v6` adds a fixed-projection sibling tail conditional only on root edge
opening, plus the current internal empirical-inflation sibling tail when its
strict support contract is available. This separates the edge-opening
boundary from the empirical-inflation layer.

## Key Points

- The replay contract verifies that each selected merge is a minimum active
  average-linkage pair. It fails if the linkage matrix and condensed distances
  disagree instead of repairing or guessing.
- The final root merge has no competitor because only two active clusters
  remain. The selected-region information is therefore in the merge
  inequalities that construct the root child clusters, not in a fictitious
  final-root margin.
- Five representative cases were run:
  `binary_low_noise_2c`, `cat_mod_4cat_6c`, `dim_diffuse_6c_136f`,
  `dim_diffuse_6c_136f_continuous`, and `cat_highcard_20cat_4c`.
- Hamming/discretized and categorical root selections are dominated by exact
  or numerical-zero merge margins. Near-active construction counts are `18`,
  `89`, `89`, and `133` in the four non-continuous representatives.
- In schema `v5`, those four non-continuous representatives are classified as
  `discrete_tie_cell_geometry_required`, with `18`, `89`, `89`, and `133`
  selected discrete tie-cell construction constraints.
- The continuous Euclidean diffuse representative has smooth first-order
  signed-distance geometry for all `178` root-child construction constraints.
  Its minimum merge margin is about `4.05e-4`; after dividing by the actual
  merge-inequality gradient norm, the minimum first-order signed distance is
  about `2.24e-4`; after root empirical-Gaussian null scaling, the minimum
  null-whitened first-order distance is about `1.73e-4`.
- In the eight supported moderate continuous cases, every root context has
  null-whitened first-order merge distance. The high-dimensional continuous
  case is outside the dense covariance contract and is intentionally not part
  of this relationship check.
- The continuous relationship table shows that merge-margin geometry is not
  the dominant coordinate for root selected ratio in this small panel:
  Spearman correlation with log root sibling ratio is about `-0.024` for raw
  merge margin, `0.095` for ambient first-order distance, and `-0.190` for
  null-whitened first-order distance.
- The edge-opening fields are the dominant coordinates in the same panel:
  `root_edge_path_radial_distance`, `root_edge_path_statistic_margin`, and
  `root_edge_path_bh_action` each have Spearman correlation `1.0` against log
  root sibling ratio. This supports the current selected-region direction:
  analyze the edge-opening boundary/action, not more merge-margin tuning.
- The edge/sibling relationship diagnostic verifies the barycentric z-identity
  in the default no-branch-scaling path. Across the five representative root
  rows, the maximum relative residual between \(z_{L,u}\) and \(z_{L,R}\), and
  between \(z_{R,u}\) and \(-z_{L,R}\), is about `2.11e-8`; across the eight
  supported continuous rows it is about `4.17e-8`.
- In the supported continuous panel, the root sibling projection dimension
  equals the parent edge projection dimension in every row, so the extra edge
  projection energy is constant `0` and the edge/sibling projection-energy
  ratio is constant `1`. In the mixed representative panel, categorical cases
  can have extra parent-projection edge energy when the sibling projection
  dimension is lower than the parent edge dimension.
- Schema `v6` computes the fixed-projection root sibling tail
  \(P(X\ge x_{\mathrm{obs}}\mid X+Y\ge q_{1-\alpha,k_e})\), where
  \(X\sim\chi^2_{k_s}\) is sibling energy and
  \(Y\sim\chi^2_{k_e-k_s}\) is the extra edge-projection energy. Equal
  projection cases reduce to a truncated chi-square tail.
- Edge conditioning alone does not explain the observed blockers. In
  `dim_diffuse_6c_136f`, the raw root sibling p-value is about
  `3.83e-165`, the edge-conditioned p-value is about `3.83e-162`, and neither
  blocks at `SIBLING_ALPHA = 0.01`; the current empirical-inflation p-value is
  about `0.0118` and blocks. In
  `dim_diffuse_6c_136f_continuous`, the corresponding p-values are about
  `6.10e-15`, `6.10e-12`, and `0.123`.
- `cat_highcard_20cat_4c` remains a calibration-support problem, not an
  edge-conditioning problem: the raw and edge-conditioned root sibling
  p-values are about `2.26e-289` and `2.26e-286`, while internal empirical
  inflation is explicitly `unsupported_internal_empirical_null`.
- Root selected sibling ratios remain large in all five representatives:
  about `755`, `748`, `379`, `32.7`, and `665`, respectively.
- Root edge-path BH actions are enormous for Hamming/discretized and
  categorical representatives, but lower for the continuous Euclidean
  representative (`14.2`). The root edge path uses the weaker of the two root
  child edges because both edges must open.
- The diagnostic supports a sharper selected-region question: tie-heavy
  discrete hierarchy cells and positive-margin continuous hierarchy cells
  likely need separate geometric descriptions before any external selected
  tail law can be production-valid.
- Curvature is still not computed. The continuous output marks curvature as
  `not_materialized_high_dimensional_hessian_operator`; this is an explicit
  remaining proof/diagnostic gap, not a fallback.

## Evidence

- `tests/validation/calibration/root/selected/55_test_root_selected_region_margins.py` verifies average
  linkage replay, rejects a nonminimal linkage matrix, and marks the
  two-leaf root case as having root children that are leaves.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/root_selected_region_margins_20260603/manifest.json`
  records schema `root_selected_region_margins/v6`, five root rows, `775`
  merge-margin rows, nine relationship rows, and the diagnostic role
  `descriptive_root_selected_region_geometry_not_calibration`.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/root_selected_region_margins_20260603_continuous/manifest.json`
  records schema `root_selected_region_margins/v6`, eight supported continuous
  root rows, `1124` merge-margin rows, and nine relationship rows.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/root_selected_region_margins_20260603/root_selected_region_summary.csv`
  records one row per representative case with root edge, sibling, spectral,
  and margin summaries.
- `raw/assets/benchmark-results/root_selected_region_margins_20260603/root_selected_region_merge_margins.csv`
  records step-level merge margins and root-child construction roles.
