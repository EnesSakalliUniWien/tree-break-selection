# Tests Overview

The suite is organized by pipeline layer so you can validate fast structural behavior first, then
statistics, traversal, pipeline contracts, integration, and visualization.

## Directory Structure

```text

## Current Suite Map

The ordered gate currently collects 1,366 test cases:

| Stage | Responsibility | Tests |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| 1 | Core structure and decomposition (`core/`, `tree/`) | 140 |
| 2 | Statistical engines and calibration (`statistics/`) | 229 |
| 3 | Localization and post-hoc merge behavior (`localization/`) | 33 |
| 4 | Validation, calibration, and diagnostic studies (`validation/`) | 752 |
| 5 | Pipeline and application contracts (`pipeline/`, `applications/`) | 171 |
| 6 | Integration smoke and visualization (`integration/`, `visualization/`) | 37 |
| 7 | Wiki memory contracts (`wiki/`) | 4 |

Stage 4 is large because it includes 568 collected calibration cases. Its
remaining cases cover validation contracts (3), diagnostic annotations (2),
spectral behavior (26), statistical validation (35), sweeps (9), tree
validation (18), and 91 direct validation tests at the stage root.

`conftest.py` is the only shared root test module. Tests otherwise belong to
the directory matching the production or research responsibility they protect.
For example, distributional-action formulas live in `statistics/`, while the
optional benchmark annotation contract lives in
`validation/diagnostics/analysis/`.

## Recommended Test Execution Order

Use the lean development environment for targeted suites:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra benchmark --extra viz --locked
```

Use the full test environment before running the full suite. The full suite
includes scRNA and optional GPL paths backed by `scanpy`, `anndata`, and
`graphtools`.

```bash
uv sync --extra all --extra experimental-gpl --locked
```

Use the helper script when you want the staged order the repository expects:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_tests_ordered.py --list
uv run python scripts/run_tests_ordered.py --stage 1
uv run python scripts/run_tests_ordered.py
```

Or run the suites directly:

```bash
# 1) Core structure + decomposition
uv run pytest tests/core/ tests/tree/

# 2) Statistical engines + calibration
uv run pytest tests/statistics/

# 3) Traversal and gate behavior
uv run pytest tests/localization/

# 4) Validation, calibration + diagnostic studies
uv run pytest tests/validation/

# 5) Pipeline + application contracts and reporting artifacts
uv run pytest tests/pipeline/ tests/applications/

# 6) Integration smoke + visualization
uv run pytest tests/integration/ tests/visualization/

# 7) Wiki memory contracts
uv run pytest tests/wiki/

# Full suite
uv run pytest
```

## Notes

- Grouping is by intent, not by a strict import dependency graph.
- If you touched decomposition logic, start with `tests/core/`, `tests/statistics/`, and `tests/localization/`.
- For benchmark or artifact-generation changes, prioritize `tests/pipeline/` and `tests/integration/`.
- Research diagnostics belong in `benchmarks/diagnostics/` with focused
  validation tests under `tests/validation/` or `tests/pipeline/`.
