## Active Method Flow

1. Build node distributions on the `PosetTree`.
2. Build spectral/projection context for each node.
3. Run branch-time-inflated child-parent projected-Wald tests.
4. Run the configured sibling gate. The default path collects sibling pair
   records and estimates empirical-null inflation as diagnostic evidence. Its
   positive-dimensional same-selected-hierarchy reference law is unresolved,
   so it withholds calibrated p-values and sibling FDR. The opt-in fixed-subspace path skips parent PCA and
   edge-derived sibling dimensions, then applies either the full fixed
   chi-square statistic or coordinate-wise/feature-block BH p-value
   aggregation before traversal-aligned sibling FDR. A positive
   `sibling_gate_alpha_penalty` divides the sibling FDR alpha before
   annotation, matching the selected-topology penalty used in diagnostics. An
   optional root-stability guard can then fail closed on an unstable open root
   split without changing non-root sibling decisions. Validation-only profiles
   can attach selected-permutation diagnostics with explicit scope: `root`,
   broad `open_internal`, narrower `passthrough_descendant` contexts, or the
   conservative `global_sibling_min_passthrough_descendant` selected-family
   correction. These diagnostics are for understanding selected-tree null
   behavior, not for defining the TBS runtime method. The refined global scope
   reruns selected-family Monte Carlo floor pass-through cases at higher
   resolution before accepting the diagnostic split.
   Pure Bernoulli and pure categorical fixed-coordinate BH p-values use the
   exact vectorized `compute_whitened_wald_contrast` path before the existing
   coordinate-wise BH aggregation.
5. Write sibling gate columns.
6. `TreeDecomposition` consumes the annotation bundle during top-down traversal.

## Contracts

- Feature-space covariance and contrast dimensions come from the active
  `FeatureSpace`; tests should not infer alternate schema names.
- Missing support and an unvalidated calibration reference law are distinct
  explicit method statuses. Neither is replaced with a neutral inflation value.
- Projection quantities and raw feature coordinates are separate objects.
- Fixed-subspace sibling gates are opt-in method choices, not automatic
  production promotion.
- Selected-permutation guard scopes are validation diagnostics, not TBS method
  choices. The
  `passthrough_descendant` scope targets descendant splits reached through an
  ordinary closed sibling ancestor and avoids compounding below explicitly
  guard-blocked roots. The
  `global_sibling_min_passthrough_descendant` scope evaluates those
  pass-through descendants against the minimum fixed-subspace sibling p-value
  over every binary parent in a fully reselected permutation null tree.
- DataFrame annotations are a transport format for gate columns; statistical
  kernels should use typed records where available.
